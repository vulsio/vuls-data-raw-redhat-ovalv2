    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Netty's netty-codec due to unrestricted chunk lengths in the SnappyFrameDecoder. By sending a specially-crafted input, a remote attacker could cause excessive memory usage resulting in a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: In OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), the Hive/Presto/Hadoop components that comprise the OCP Metering stack, ship the vulnerable version of netty-codec package.\nSince the release of OCP 4.6, the Metering product has been deprecated [1], hence the affected components are marked as wontfix.\nThis may be fixed in the future.\n\nStarting in OCP 4.7, the elasticsearch component is shipping as a part of the OpenShift Logging product (openshift-logging/elasticsearch6-rhel8). The elasticsearch component delivered in OCP 4.6 is marked as `Out of support scope` because these versions are already under Maintenance Phase of the support.\n\n[1] https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/release_notes/ocp-4-6-release-notes.html#ocp-4-6-metering-operator-deprecated",
