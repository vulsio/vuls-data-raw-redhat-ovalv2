		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in the MySQL Connectors product of Oracle MySQL (component: Connector/J). This issue may allow unauthenticated attackers with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Connectors. Successful attacks can result in a takeover of MySQL Connectors. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate because it is difficult to exploit and requires user interaction.\n\nThe package mariadb Java client is available in Red Hat Software Collections. It can be installed this way:\n\n  # yum-config-manager --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms\n  # yum install rh-mariadb105-mariadb-java-client\n\nThis JDBC driver works fine with both MariaDB and MySQL servers. We recommend use of mariadb-java-client over mysql-java-connector where possible.",
