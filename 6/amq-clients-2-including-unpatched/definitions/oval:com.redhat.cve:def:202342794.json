		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Apache Tomcat. An incomplete cleanup vulnerability with the internal fork of the Commons FileUpload package exposed a potential denial of service on Windows if a web application opened a stream for an uploaded file but failed to close the stream. The file would never be deleted from the disk, potentially leading to a denial of service due to the disk being full. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat rates this flaw as a Moderate impact as this would depend on how much information an attacker has over the environment (version and disk for example, increasing the Attack Complexity) as there is no guarantee the attack is successful. \nThis may affect only scenarios where running an application on Windows.\n            MITIGATION: No mitigation is currently available for this flaw.",
