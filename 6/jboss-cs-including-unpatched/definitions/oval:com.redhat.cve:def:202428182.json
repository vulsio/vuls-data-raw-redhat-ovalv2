		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in how nghttp2 implements the HTTP/2 protocol. There are insufficient limitations placed on the amount of CONTINUATION frames that can be sent within a single stream. This issue could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to send packets to vulnerable servers, which could use up compute or memory resources to cause a Denial of Service. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat rates the security impact of this vulnerability as Moderate, in alignment with upstream Envoy. The worst case scenario is excessive CPU utilization causing a denial of service. Once an attack has ended, the system should return to normal operations on its own.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
