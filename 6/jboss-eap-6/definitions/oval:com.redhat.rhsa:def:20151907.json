    "description": "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java\napplications based on JBoss Application Server 7.\n\nIt was discovered that sending requests containing large headers to the Web\nConsole produced a Java OutOfMemoryError in the HTTP management interface.\nAn attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2015-5220)\n\nIt was discovered that the EAP Management Console could be opened in an\nIFRAME, which made it possible to intercept and manipulate requests.\nAn attacker could use this flaw to trick a user into performing arbitrary\nactions in the Console (clickjacking). (CVE-2015-5178)\n\nNote: Resolving this issue required a change in the way http requests are\nsent in the Console; this change may affect users. See the Release Notes\nlinked to in the References section for details about this change.\n\nIt was discovered that when uploading a file using a multipart/form-data\nsubmission to the EAP Web Console, the Console was vulnerable to Cross-Site\nRequest Forgery (CSRF). This meant that an attacker could use the flaw\ntogether with a forgery attack to make changes to an authenticated\ninstance. (CVE-2015-5188)\n\nThe CVE-2015-5220 issue was discovered by Aaron Ogburn of Red Hat GSS\nMiddleware Team, and the CVE-2015-5188 issue was discovered by Jason Greene\nof the Red Hat Middleware Engineering Team.\n\n* The jboss-ec2-eap packages provide scripts for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform running on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic\nCompute Cloud (EC2). With this update, the packages have been updated to\nensure compatibility with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform\n6.4.4. Documentation for these changes is available from the link in the\nReferences section.\n\nAll jboss-ec2-eap users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform\n6.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to\ntake effect.",
