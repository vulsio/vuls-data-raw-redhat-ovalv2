		"description": "Red Hat Identity Management is a centralized authentication, identity\nmanagement and authorization solution for both traditional and cloud-based\nenterprise environments.\n\nA weakness was found in the way IPA clients communicated with IPA servers\nwhen initially attempting to join IPA domains. As there was no secure way\nto provide the IPA server's Certificate Authority (CA) certificate to the\nclient during a join, the IPA client enrollment process was susceptible to\nman-in-the-middle attacks. This flaw could allow an attacker to obtain\naccess to the IPA server using the credentials provided by an IPA client,\nincluding administrative access to the entire domain if the join was\nperformed using an administrator's credentials. (CVE-2012-5484)\n\nNote: This weakness was only exposed during the initial client join to the\nrealm, because the IPA client did not yet have the CA certificate of the\nserver. Once an IPA client has joined the realm and has obtained the CA\ncertificate of the IPA server, all further communication is secure. If a\nclient were using the OTP (one-time password) method to join to the realm,\nan attacker could only obtain unprivileged access to the server (enough to\nonly join the realm).\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Petr Menšík for reporting this issue.\n\nThis update must be installed on both the IPA client and IPA server. When\nthis update has been applied to the client but not the server,\nipa-client-install, in unattended mode, will fail if you do not have the\ncorrect CA certificate locally, noting that you must use the \"--force\"\noption to insecurely obtain the certificate. In interactive mode, the\ncertificate will try to be obtained securely from LDAP. If this fails, you\nwill be prompted to insecurely download the certificate via HTTP. In the\nsame situation when using OTP, LDAP will not be queried and you will be\nprompted to insecurely download the certificate via HTTP.\n\nUsers of ipa are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncorrect this issue. After installing the update, changes in LDAP are\nhandled by ipa-ldap-updater automatically and are effective immediately.",
