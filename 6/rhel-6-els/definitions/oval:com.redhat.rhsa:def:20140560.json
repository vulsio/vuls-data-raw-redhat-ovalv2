    "description": "The libvirt library is a C API for managing and interacting with the\nvirtualization capabilities of Linux and other operating systems. In \naddition, libvirt provides tools for remote management of virtualized\nsystems. \n\nIt was found that libvirt passes the XML_PARSE_NOENT flag when parsing XML\ndocuments using the libxml2 library, in which case all XML entities in the\nparsed documents are expanded. A user able to force libvirtd to parse an\nXML document with an entity pointing to a special file that blocks on read\naccess could use this flaw to cause libvirtd to hang indefinitely,\nresulting in a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2014-0179)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the upstream Libvirt project for reporting this\nissue. Upstream acknowledges Daniel P. Berrange and Richard Jones as the\noriginal reporters.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* When hot unplugging a virtual CPU (vCPU), libvirt kept a pointer to\nalready freed memory if the vCPU was pinned to a host CPU. Consequently,\nwhen reading the CPU pinning information, libvirt terminated unexpectedly\ndue to an attempt to access this memory. This update ensures that libvirt\nreleases the pointer to the previously allocated memory when a vCPU is\nbeing hot unplugged, and it no longer crashes in this situation.\n(BZ#1091206)\n\n* Previously, libvirt passed an incorrect argument to the \"tc\" command when\nsetting quality of service (QoS) on a network interface controller (NIC).\nAs a consequence, QoS was applied only to IP traffic. With this update,\nlibvirt constructs the \"tc\" command correctly so that QoS is applied to all\ntraffic as expected. (BZ#1096806)\n\n* When using the sanlock daemon for managing access to shared storage,\nlibvirt expected all QEMU domains to be registered with sanlock. However,\nif a QEMU domain was started prior to enabling sanlock, the domain was not\nregistered with sanlock. Consequently, migration of a virtual machine (VM)\nfrom such a QEMU domain failed with a libvirt error. With this update,\nlibvirt verifies whether a QEMU domain process is registered with sanlock\nbefore it starts working with the domain, ensuring that migration of\nvirtual machines works as expected. (BZ#1097227)\n\nAll libvirt users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the\nupdated packages, libvirtd will be restarted automatically.",
