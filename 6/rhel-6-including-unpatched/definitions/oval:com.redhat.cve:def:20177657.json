		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all configurations), and 9.4.x (non-default configuration with RFC2616 compliance enabled), transfer-encoding chunks are handled poorly. The chunk length parsing was vulnerable to an integer overflow. Thus a large chunk size could be interpreted as a smaller chunk size and content sent as chunk body could be interpreted as a pipelined request. If Jetty was deployed behind an intermediary that imposed some authorization and that intermediary allowed arbitrarily large chunks to be passed on unchanged, then this flaw could be used to bypass the authorization imposed by the intermediary as the fake pipelined request would not be interpreted by the intermediary as a request. \n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the versions of jetty embedded in the nutch package as shipped with Red Hat Satellite 5. The nutch service is not exposed, as such exploitation is difficult, Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having security impact of Low. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.\n\nThis issue affects the version of jetty in Red Hat Data Grid 7's agent-bond utility, which is deprecated and only available for backward compatibility. Customers should use Prometheus JMX instead. This flaw does not affect Red Hat Data Grid 8.",
