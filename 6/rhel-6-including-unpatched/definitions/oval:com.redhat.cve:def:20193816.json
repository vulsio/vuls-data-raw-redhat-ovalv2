    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: Openwsman, versions up to and including 2.6.9, are vulnerable to arbitrary file disclosure because the working directory of openwsmand daemon was set to root directory. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to openwsman server. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat OpenStack Platform currently only utilizes the client and python client API bindings, not the server components of openwsman. Additionally, updates for this package are received through the Red Hat Enterprise Linux repository.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Virtualization uses only the openwsman-python client API bindings, not the server components of openwsman.\n\nThis issue affects the versions of openwsman as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is now in Maintenance Support 2 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having a security impact of Important, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",
