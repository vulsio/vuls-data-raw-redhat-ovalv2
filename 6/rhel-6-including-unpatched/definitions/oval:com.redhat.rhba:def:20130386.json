		"description": "The tuned packages contain a daemon that tunes system settings dynamically. It does so by monitoring the usage of several system components periodically. \n\nThis update fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1 and later enters processor power-saving states more aggressively. This could result in a small performance penalty on certain workloads. With this update, the pmqos-static.py daemon has been added to the tuned packages, which allows to set the requested latency using the kernel Power Management QoS interface. It is run when the \"latency-performance\" profile is activated and it sets cpu_dma_latency=0, which keeps the CPU in C0 state, thus making the system as responsive as possible. (BZ#714180)\n\n* When the ELEVATOR_TUNE_DEVS option was set to a disk device in the /etc/sysconfig/ktune file instead of providing a disk scheduler control file, the scheduler setting was not written to a disk scheduler control file but directly into the disk device file. Consequently, contents of the disk could become corrupted. With this update, the value of ELEVATOR_TUNE_DEVS is checked and only the disk scheduler control file is allowed for writing. As a result, an invalid value of ELEVATOR_TUNE_DEVS is detected in the described scenario so that the disk contents damage can be prevented. (BZ#784308)\n\n* When the tuned daemon run with the \"enterprise-storage\" profile enabled and a non-root, non-boot disk partition from a device with write-back cache was mounted, tuned remounted the partition with the \"nobarriers\" option. If a power failure occurred at that time, the file system could become corrupted. With this update, tuned can detect usage of write-back cache on devices communicating with kernel via SCSI. In these cases, \"nobarriers\" is now disabled, thus preventing this bug in the described scenario. (BZ#801561)\n\n* Previously, when the tuned service was started, the tuned PID file was created with world-writable permissions. This bug has been fixed and the /var/run/tuned/tuned.pid file is now created with correct permissions as expected. (BZ#845336)\n\n* On a machine with hot-plug disk devices with the \"enterprise-storage\" profile activated, a new disk device could be added into the system, or the disk could be removed and inserted back. In such a scenario, the scheduler and read-ahead settings from the profile were not applied on the newly-added disks. With this update, a new udev rule has been added, which restarts the ktune daemon whenever a new disk device is added, thus fixing this bug. (BZ#847445)\n\n* The transparent hugepage kernel thread could interfere with latency-sensitive applications. To lower the latency, the transparent hugepages are now disabled in the latency-performance tuned profile. (BZ#887355)\n\n* Previously, non-root, non-boot partitions were re-mounted using the \"nobarrier\" option to improve performance. On virtual guests, this could lead to data corruption if power supply was suddenly interrupted, because there was usually a host cache in transfer. This bug has been fixed and the virtual-guest profile no longer re-mounts partitions using \"nobarrier\". (BZ#886956)\n\nUsers of tuned are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix these bugs.",
