		"description": "The glibc packages provide the standard C libraries (libc), POSIX thread\nlibraries (libpthread), standard math libraries (libm), and the Name Server\nCaching Daemon (nscd) used by multiple programs on the system. Without\nthese libraries, the Linux system cannot function correctly.\n\nMultiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,\nwere found in glibc's memory allocator functions (pvalloc, valloc, and\nmemalign). If an application used such a function, it could cause the\napplication to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the\nprivileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2013-4332)\n\nA flaw was found in the regular expression matching routines that process\nmultibyte character input. If an application utilized the glibc regular\nexpression matching mechanism, an attacker could provide specially-crafted\ninput that, when processed, would cause the application to crash.\n(CVE-2013-0242)\n\nIt was found that getaddrinfo() did not limit the amount of stack memory\nused during name resolution. An attacker able to make an application\nresolve an attacker-controlled hostname or IP address could possibly cause\nthe application to exhaust all stack memory and crash. (CVE-2013-1914)\n\nAmong other changes, this update includes an important fix for the following bug:\n\n* Due to a defect in the initial release of the getaddrinfo() system call in Red Hat enterprise Linux 6.0, AF_INET and AF_INET6 queries resolved from the /etc/hosts file returned queried names as canonical names. This incorrect behavior is, however, still considered to be the expected behavior. As a result of a recent change in getaddrinfo(), AF_INET6 queries started resolving the canonical names correctly. However, this behavior was unexpected by applications that relied on queries resolved from the /etc/hosts file, and these applications could thus fail to operate properly. This update applies a fix ensuring that AF_INET6 queries resolved from /etc/hosts always return the queried name as canonical. Note that DNS lookups are resolved properly and always return the correct canonical names. A proper fix to AF_INET6 queries resolution from /etc/hosts may be applied in future releases; for now, due to a lack of standard, Red Hat suggests the first entry in the /etc/hosts file, that applies for the IP address being resolved, to be considered the canonical entry. (BZ#1022022)\n\nThese updated glibc packages also include additional bug fixes and \nvarious enhancements. Space precludes documenting all of these changes \nin this advisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 \nTechnical Notes, linked to in the References, for information on the \nmost significant of these changes.\n\nAll glibc users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues and add these\nenhancements.",
