		"description": "BusyBox provides a single binary that includes versions of a large number\nof system commands, including a shell. This can be very useful for\nrecovering from certain types of system failures, particularly those\ninvolving broken shared libraries.\n\nIt was found that the mdev BusyBox utility could create certain directories\nwithin /dev with world-writable permissions. A local unprivileged user\ncould use this flaw to manipulate portions of the /dev directory tree.\n(CVE-2013-1813)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, due to a too eager string size optimization on the IBM System\nz architecture, the \"wc\" BusyBox command failed after processing standard\ninput with the following error:\n\n    wc: : No such file or directory\n\nThis bug was fixed by disabling the string size optimization and the \"wc\"\ncommand works properly on IBM System z architectures. (BZ#820097)\n\n* Prior to this update, the \"mknod\" command was unable to create device\nnodes with a major or minor number larger than 255. Consequently, the kdump\nutility failed to handle such a device. The underlying source code has been\nmodified, and it is now possible to use the \"mknod\" command to create\ndevice nodes with a major or minor number larger than 255. (BZ#859817)\n\n* If a network installation from an NFS server was selected, the \"mount\"\ncommand used the UDP protocol by default. If only TCP mounts were supported\nby the server, this led to a failure of the mount command. As a result,\nAnaconda could not continue with the installation. This bug is now fixed\nand NFS mount operations default to the TCP protocol. (BZ#855832)\n\nAll busybox users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.",
