		"description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n\n* A local, unprivileged user could use an integer overflow flaw in\ndrm_mode_dirtyfb_ioctl() to cause a denial of service or escalate their\nprivileges. (CVE-2012-0044, Important)\n\n* It was found that the kvm_vm_ioctl_assign_device() function in the KVM\n(Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem of a Linux kernel did not check if\nthe user requesting device assignment was privileged or not. A local,\nunprivileged user on the host could assign unused PCI devices, or even\ndevices that were in use and whose resources were not properly claimed by\nthe respective drivers, which could result in the host crashing.\n(CVE-2011-4347, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's XFS file system\nimplementation handled on-disk Access Control Lists (ACLs). A local,\nunprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or\nescalate their privileges by mounting a specially-crafted disk.\n(CVE-2012-0038, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that the Linux kernel's register set (regset) common\ninfrastructure implementation did not check if the required get and set\nhandlers were initialized. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw\nto cause a denial of service by performing a register set operation with a\nptrace() PTRACE_SETREGSET or PTRACE_GETREGSET request. (CVE-2012-1097,\nModerate)\n\n* A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's memory management\nsubsystem in the way pmd_none_or_clear_bad(), when called with mmap_sem in\nread mode, and Transparent Huge Pages (THP) page faults interacted. A\nprivileged user in a KVM guest with the ballooning functionality enabled\ncould potentially use this flaw to crash the host. A local, unprivileged\nuser could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2012-1179, Moderate)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Chen Haogang for reporting CVE-2012-0044; Sasha\nLevin for reporting CVE-2011-4347; Wang Xi for reporting CVE-2012-0038; and\nH. Peter Anvin for reporting CVE-2012-1097.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* When a RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) adapter with active RoCE\ncommunications was taken down suddenly (either by adapter failure or the\nintentional shutdown of the interface), the ongoing RoCE communications\ncould cause the kernel to panic and render the machine unusable. A patch\nhas been provided to protect the kernel in this situation and to pass an\nerror up to the application still using the interface after it has been\ntaken down instead. (BZ#799944)\n\n* The fix for Red Hat Bugzilla bug 713494, released via RHSA-2011:0928,\nintroduced a regression. Attempting to change the state of certain\nfeatures, such as GRO (Generic Receive Offload) or TSO (TCP segment\noffloading), for a 10 Gigabit Ethernet card that is being used in a\nvirtual LAN (VLAN) resulted in a kernel panic. (BZ#816974)\n\n* If a new file was created on a Network File System version 4 (NFSv4)\nshare, the ownership was set to nfsnobody (-2) until it was possible to\nupcall to the idmapper. As a consequence, subsequent file system operations\ncould incorrectly use \"-2\" for the user and group IDs for the given file,\ncausing certain operations to fail. In reported cases, this issue also\ncaused \"Viminfo file is not writable\" errors for users running Vim with\nfiles on an NFSv4 share. (BZ#820960)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.",
