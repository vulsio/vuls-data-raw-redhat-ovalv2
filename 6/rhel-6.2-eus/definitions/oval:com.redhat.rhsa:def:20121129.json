		"description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n\n* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the nf_ct_frag6_reasm()\nfunction in the Linux kernel's netfilter IPv6 connection tracking\nimplementation. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send\nspecially-crafted packets to a target system that is using IPv6 and also\nhas the nf_conntrack_ipv6 kernel module loaded, causing it to crash.\n(CVE-2012-2744, Important)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Event Poll (epoll)\nsubsystem handled large, nested epoll structures. A local, unprivileged\nuser could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1083,\nModerate)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank an anonymous contributor working with the\nBeyond Security SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program for reporting\nCVE-2012-2744, and Nelson Elhage for reporting CVE-2011-1083.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Attempting to turn on Data Center Bridging (DCB) on a port connected to a\nnon-DCB switch port caused the system to become unresponsive or even\nterminate. This was because napi_poll routines in the ixgbe driver did not\nend the NAPI when data processing was complete. With this update, the ixgbe\nnapi_poll routines have been fixed so that they now call the\nnapi_complete() function when data processing has finished. This ensures\nthat the NAPI is correctly disabled, and thus prevents possible hangs and\ncrashes in this scenario. (BZ#814454)\n\n* If a new file was created on a Network File System version 4 (NFSv4)\nshare, the ownership was set to nfsnobody (-2) until it was possible to\nupcall to the idmapper. As a consequence, subsequent file system operations\ncould incorrectly use \"-2\" for the user and group IDs for the given file,\ncausing certain operations to fail. In reported cases, this issue also\ncaused \"Viminfo file is not writable\" errors for users running Vim with\nfiles on an NFSv4 share. (BZ#820962)\n\n* Previously, the size of the multicast IGMP (Internet Group Management\nProtocol) snooping hash table for a bridge was limited to 256 entries even\nthough the maximum is 512. This was due to the hash table size being\nincorrectly compared to the maximum hash table size, hash_max, and the\nfollowing message could have been produced by the kernel:\n\n    Multicast hash table maximum reached, disabling snooping: vnet1, 512\n\nWith this update, the hash table value is correctly compared to the\nhash_max value, and the error message no longer occurs under these\ncircumstances. (BZ#840021)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to resolve these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.",
