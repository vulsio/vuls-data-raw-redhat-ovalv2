		"description": "The xorg-x11-server-utils package contains a collection of utilities used\nto modify and query the runtime configuration of the X.Org server. X.Org is\nan open source implementation of the X Window System.\n\nA flaw was found in the X.Org X server resource database utility, xrdb.\nCertain variables were not properly sanitized during the launch of a user's\ngraphical session, which could possibly allow a remote attacker to execute\narbitrary code with root privileges, if they were able to make the display\nmanager execute xrdb with a specially-crafted X client hostname. For\nexample, by configuring the hostname on the target system via a crafted\nDHCP reply, or by using the X Display Manager Control Protocol (XDMCP) to\nconnect to that system from a host that has a special DNS name.\n(CVE-2011-0465)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Matthieu Herrb for reporting this issue.\nUpstream acknowledges Sebastian Krahmer of the SuSE Security Team as the\noriginal reporter.\n\nUsers of xorg-x11-server-utils should upgrade to this updated package,\nwhich contains a backported patch to resolve this issue. All running X.Org\nserver instances must be restarted for this update to take effect.",
