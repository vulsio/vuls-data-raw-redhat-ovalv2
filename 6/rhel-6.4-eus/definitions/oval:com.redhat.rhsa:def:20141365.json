		"description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's futex subsystem handled\nreference counting when requeuing futexes during futex_wait(). A local,\nunprivileged user could use this flaw to zero out the reference counter of\nan inode or an mm struct that backs up the memory area of the futex, which\ncould lead to a use-after-free flaw, resulting in a system crash or,\npotentially, privilege escalation. (CVE-2014-0205, Important)\n\nThe security impact of this issue was discovered by Mateusz Guzik of\nRed Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* A rare race between the file system unmount code and the file system\nnotification code could lead to a kernel panic. With this update, a series\nof patches has been applied to the kernel to prevent this problem.\n(BZ#1130628)\n\n* Previously, recovery of a double-degraded RAID6 array could, under\ncertain circumstances, result in data corruption. This could happen because\nthe md driver was using an optimization that is safe to use only for\nsingle-degraded arrays. This update ensures that this optimization is\nskipped during the recovery of double-degraded RAID6 arrays. (BZ#1131410)\n\n* Later Intel CPUs added a new \"Condition Changed\" bit to the\nMSR_CORE_PERF_GLOBAL_STATUS register. Previously, the kernel falsely\nassumed that this bit indicates a performance interrupt, which prevented\nother NMI handlers from running and executing. To fix this problem, a\npatch has been applied to the kernel to ignore this bit in the perf code,\nenabling other NMI handlers to run. (BZ#1134695)\n\n* Previously, certain network device drivers did not accept ethtool\ncommands right after they were mounted. As a consequence, the current\nsetting of the specified device driver was not applied and an error message\nwas returned. The ETHTOOL_DELAY variable has been added, which makes sure\nthe ethtool utility waits for some time before it tries to apply the\noptions settings, thus fixing the bug. (BZ#1138300)\n\nAll kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.",
