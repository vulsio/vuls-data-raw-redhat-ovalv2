		"description": "The openchange packages provide libraries to access Microsoft Exchange\nservers using native protocols. Evolution-MAPI uses these libraries to\nintegrate the Evolution PIM application with Microsoft Exchange servers.\n\nA flaw was found in the Samba suite's Perl-based DCE/RPC IDL (PIDL)\ncompiler. As OpenChange uses code generated by PIDL, this could have\nresulted in buffer overflows in the way OpenChange handles RPC calls. With\nthis update, the code has been generated with an updated version of PIDL to\ncorrect this issue. (CVE-2012-1182)\n\nThe openchange packages have been upgraded to upstream version 1.0, which\nprovides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version,\nincluding support for the rebased samba4 packages and several API changes.\n(BZ#767672, BZ#767678)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* When the user tried to modify a meeting with one required attendee and\nhimself as the organizer, a segmentation fault occurred in the memcpy()\nfunction. Consequently, the evolution-data-server application terminated\nunexpectedly with a segmentation fault. This bug has been fixed and\nevolution-data-server no longer crashes in the described scenario.\n(BZ#680061)\n\n* Prior to this update, OpenChange 1.0 was unable to send messages with\na large message body or with extensive attachment. This was caused by minor\nissues in OpenChange's exchange.idl definitions. This bug has been fixed\nand OpenChange now sends extensive messages without complications.\n(BZ#870405)\n\nAll users of openchange are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich fix these issues and add these enhancements.",
