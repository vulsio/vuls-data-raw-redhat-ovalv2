		"description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* It was found that the Linux kernel's Infiniband subsystem did not\nproperly sanitize input parameters while registering memory regions from\nuser space via the (u)verbs API. A local user with access to a\n/dev/infiniband/uverbsX device could use this flaw to crash the system or,\npotentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-8159,\nImportant)\n\n* A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP\nimplementation handled authentication key reference counting during INIT\ncollisions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system or,\npotentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-1421,\nImportant)\n\n* An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Frame\nBuffer device implementation mapped kernel memory to user space via the\nmmap syscall. A local user able to access a frame buffer device file\n(/dev/fb*) could possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the\nsystem. (CVE-2013-2596, Important)\n\n* It was found that the Linux kernel's KVM implementation did not ensure\nthat the host CR4 control register value remained unchanged across VM\nentries on the same virtual CPU. A local, unprivileged user could use this\nflaw to cause a denial of service on the system. (CVE-2014-3690, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that the parse_rock_ridge_inode_internal() function of the\nLinux kernel's ISOFS implementation did not correctly check relocated\ndirectories when processing Rock Ridge child link (CL) tags. An attacker\nwith physical access to the system could use a specially crafted ISO image\nto crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the\nsystem. (CVE-2014-5471, CVE-2014-5472, Low)\n\n* A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the TechnoTrend/Hauppauge\nDEC USB device driver. A local user with write access to the corresponding\ndevice could use this flaw to crash the kernel or, potentially, elevate\ntheir privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-8884, Low)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Mellanox for reporting CVE-2014-8159, and Andy\nLutomirski for reporting CVE-2014-3690. The CVE-2015-1421 issue was\ndiscovered by Sun Baoliang of Red Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, a NULL pointer check that is needed to prevent an oops in the\nnfs_async_inode_return_delegation() function was removed. As a consequence,\na NFS4 client could terminate unexpectedly. The missing NULL pointer check\nhas been added back, and NFS4 client no longer crashes in this situation.\n(BZ#1187638)\n\n* Due to unbalanced multicast join and leave processing, the attempt to\nleave a multicast group that had not previously completed a join became\nunresponsive. This update resolves multiple locking issues in the IPoIB\nmulticast code that allowed multicast groups to be left before the joining\nwas entirely completed. Now, multicast join and leave failures or lockups\nno longer occur in the described situation. (BZ#1187663)\n\n* A failure to leave a multicast group which had previously been joined\nprevented the attempt to unregister from the \"sa\" service. Multiple locking\nissues in the IPoIB multicast join and leave processing have been fixed so\nthat leaving a group that has completed its join process is successful.\nAs a result, attempts to unregister from the \"sa\" service no longer lock up\ndue to leaked resources. (BZ#1187665)\n\n* Due to a regression, when large reads which partially extended beyond the\nend of the underlying device were done, the raw driver returned the EIO\nerror code instead of returning a short read covering the valid part of the\ndevice. The underlying source code has been patched, and the raw driver now\nreturns a short read for the remainder of the device. (BZ#1195746)\n\nAll kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.",
