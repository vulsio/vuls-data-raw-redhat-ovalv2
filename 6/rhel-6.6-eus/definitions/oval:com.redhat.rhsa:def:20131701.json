    "description": "The sudo (superuser do) utility allows system administrators to give\ncertain users the ability to run commands as root.\n\nA flaw was found in the way sudo handled time stamp files. An attacker able\nto run code as a local user and with the ability to control the system\nclock could possibly gain additional privileges by running commands that\nthe victim user was allowed to run via sudo, without knowing the victim's\npassword. (CVE-2013-1775)\n\nIt was found that sudo did not properly validate the controlling terminal\ndevice when the tty_tickets option was enabled in the /etc/sudoers file.\nAn attacker able to run code as a local user could possibly gain additional\nprivileges by running commands that the victim user was allowed to run via\nsudo, without knowing the victim's password. (CVE-2013-2776, CVE-2013-2777)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, sudo did not support netgroup filtering for sources from the\nSystem Security Services Daemon (SSSD). Consequently, SSSD rules were\napplied to all users even when they did not belong to the specified\nnetgroup. With this update, netgroup filtering for SSSD sources has been\nimplemented. As a result, rules with a netgroup specification are applied\nonly to users that are part of the netgroup. (BZ#880150)\n\n* When the sudo utility set up the environment in which it ran a command,\nit reset the value of the RLIMIT_NPROC resource limit to the parent's value\nof this limit if both the soft (current) and hard (maximum) values of\nRLIMIT_NPROC were not limited. An upstream patch has been provided to\naddress this bug and RLIMIT_NPROC can now be set to \"unlimited\".\n(BZ#947276)\n\n* Due to the refactoring of the sudo code by upstream, the SUDO_USER\nvariable that stores the name of the user running the sudo command was not\nlogged to the /var/log/secure file as before. Consequently, user name\n\"root\" was always recorded instead of the real user name. With this update,\nthe previous behavior of sudo has been restored. As a result, the expected\nuser name is now written to /var/log/secure. (BZ#973228)\n\n* Due to an error in a loop condition in sudo's rule listing code, a buffer\noverflow could have occurred in certain cases. This condition has been\nfixed and the buffer overflow no longer occurs. (BZ#994626)\n\nIn addition, this update adds the following enhancements:\n\n* With this update, sudo has been modified to send debug messages about\nnetgroup matching to the debug log. These messages should provide better\nunderstanding of how sudo matches netgroup database records with values\nfrom the running system and what the values are exactly. (BZ#848111)\n\n* With this update, sudo has been modified to accept the ipa_hostname value\nfrom the /etc/sssd/sssd.conf configuration file when matching netgroups.\n(BZ#853542)\n\nAll sudo users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to correct these issues and add\nthese enhancements.",
