    "description": "The wget package provides the GNU Wget file retrieval utility for HTTP,\nHTTPS, and FTP protocols. Wget provides various useful features, such as\nthe ability to work in the background while the user is logged out,\nrecursive retrieval of directories, file name wildcard matching or updating\nfiles in dependency on file timestamp comparison.\n\nIt was discovered that wget used a file name provided by the server when\nsaving a downloaded file. This could cause wget to create a file with a\ndifferent name than expected, possibly allowing the server to execute\narbitrary code on the client. (CVE-2010-2252)\n\nNote: With this update, wget always uses the last component of the original\nURL as the name for the downloaded file. Previous behavior of using the\nserver provided name or the last component of the redirected URL when\ncreating files can be re-enabled by using the '--trust-server-names'\ncommand line option, or by setting 'trust_server_names=on' in the wget\nstart-up file.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Prior to this update, the wget package did not recognize HTTPS SSL\ncertificates with alternative names (subjectAltName) specified in the\ncertificate as valid. As a consequence, running the wget command failed\nwith a certificate error. This update fixes wget to recognize such\ncertificates as valid. (BZ#1060113)\n\nAll users of wget are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.",
