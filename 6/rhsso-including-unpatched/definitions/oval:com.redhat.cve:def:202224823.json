		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: CVE-2021-21290 contains an incomplete fix, and this addresses the issue found in netty. When using multipart decoders in netty, local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing of uploads on the disk is enabled. \n            STATEMENT: This issue only impacts applications running on Java version 6 and lower. Additionally, this vulnerability impacts code running on Unix-like systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they all share the system temporary directory between all users.\n\nRed Hat Satellite 6 is not affected as is using netty 3.6.7 version which is not impacted by this vulnerability.\n\nRed Hat Fuse 7 is now in Maintenance Support Phase and should be fixed soon. However, Red Hat Fuse Online (Syndesis) does will not contain the fix for this flaw.\n            MITIGATION: As a workaround, specify one's own `java.io.tmpdir` when starting the JVM or use DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...) to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.",
