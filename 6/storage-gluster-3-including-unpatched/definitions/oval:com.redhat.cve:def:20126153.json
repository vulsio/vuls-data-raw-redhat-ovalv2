		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-5783 was incomplete: the code added to check that the server host name matches the domain name in a subject's Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates was flawed. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. \n            STATEMENT: Additional information can be found in the Red Hat Knowledgebase article: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1165533\n\nThis issue affects the versions of HttpComponents Client and ModeShape Client as shipped with Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6. However, this flaw is not known to be exploitable under any supported scenario in Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6. A future update may address this issue.\n\nThis issue did not affect the jakarta-commons-httpclient packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7, and httpcomponents-client packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nRed Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4,  Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 4, and Red Hat JBoss Web Server 1 are now in Phase 3, Extended Life Support, of their respective life cycles. This issue has been rated as having Important security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat JBoss Middleware and Red Hat JBoss Operations Network Product Update and Support Policy: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes/\n\nFuse ESB 4, Fuse Message Broker 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and Fuse Services Framework 2.3, 2.4 are now in a reduced support phase receiving only Critical impact security fixes. This issue has been rated as having Important security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.
