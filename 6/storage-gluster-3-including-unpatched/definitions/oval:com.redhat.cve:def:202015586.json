		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found Go's net/http package. Servers using ReverseProxy from net/http in the Go standard library are vulnerable to a data race that results in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. \n            STATEMENT: OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) components are primarily written in Go, meaning that any component using the net/http package includes the vulnerable code. OCP server endpoints using ReverseProxy are protected by authentication, reducing the severity of this vulnerability to Low for OCP.\n\nSimilar to OCP, OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM), RedHat OpenShift Jaeger (RHOSJ) and OpenShift Virtualization are also primarily written in Go and are protected via authentication, reducing the severity of this vulnerability to Low.\n\nRed Hat Gluster Storage 3 and Red Hat Openshift Container Storage 4 components are built with the affected version of Go, however the vulnerable functionality is currently not used by these products and hence this issue has been rated as having a security impact of Low.\n\nRed Hat Ceph Storage 3 and 4 components are built with the affected version of Go, however the vulnerable functionality is currently not used by these products and hence this issue has been rated as having a security impact of Low.",
