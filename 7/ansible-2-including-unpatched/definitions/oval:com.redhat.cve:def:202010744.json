		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: An incomplete fix was found for the fix of the flaw CVE-2020-1733, Ansible: insecure temporary directory when running become_user from the become directive. The provided fix is insufficient to prevent the race condition on systems using ACLs and FUSE filesystems.\n            STATEMENT: Ansible Engine 2.7.18, 2.8.12, and 2.9.9 as well as previous versions are affected.\n\nAnsible Tower 3.4.5, 3.5.6 and 3.6.4 as well as previous versions are affected.\n\nRed Hat Gluster Storage 3 and Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 no longer maintain their own versions of Ansible. The fix will be provided from core Ansible. However, we still ship Ansible separately for Ceph Ubuntu.\n\nIn Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact,  ansible is not directly customer exposed, and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP ansible package.\n            MITIGATION: Currently, there is no mitigation for this issue.",
