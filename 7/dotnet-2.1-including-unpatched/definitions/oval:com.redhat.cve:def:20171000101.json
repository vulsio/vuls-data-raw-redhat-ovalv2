		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: curl supports \"globbing\" of URLs, in which a user can pass a numerical range to have the tool iterate over those numbers to do a sequence of transfers. In the globbing function that parses the numerical range, there was an omission that made curl read a byte beyond the end of the URL if given a carefully crafted, or just wrongly written, URL. The URL is stored in a heap based buffer, so it could then be made to wrongly read something else instead of crashing. An example of a URL that triggers the flaw would be `http://ur%20[0-60000000000000000000`. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.
