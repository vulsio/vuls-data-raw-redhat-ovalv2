		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in curl. In this issue, curl can be asked to tunnel all protocols virtually it supports through an HTTP proxy. HTTP proxies can deny these tunnel operations using an appropriate HTTP error response code. When getting denied to tunnel the specific SMB or TELNET protocols, curl can use a heap-allocated struct after it has been freed and shut down the code path in its transfer. \n            STATEMENT: Potential successful exploitation will cause the curl to crash, which generates a low impact to the environment where the curl is used. Additionally, exploitation depends on the conditions that are out of the attacker's control, like usage of specific protocols (SMB or TELNET) and HTTP proxy tunnels at the same time. Due to these facts, this vulnerability has been classified as a Low severity issue.\n            MITIGATION: Avoid using the SMB and TELNET protocols.",
