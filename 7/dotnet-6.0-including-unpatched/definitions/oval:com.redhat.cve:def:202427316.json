		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in how Apache httpd implements the HTTP/2 protocol. There are insufficient limitations placed on the amount of CONTINUATION frames that can be sent within a single stream. This issue could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to send packets to vulnerable servers, which could use up memory resources to cause a Denial of Service. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat rates the security impact of this vulnerability as Moderate, in alignment with upstream Apache. The worst case scenario is memory exhaustion causing a denial of service. Once an attack has ended, the system should return to normal operations on its own.\n\nThis vulnerability stems from an imperfect definition of the HTTP/2 protocol. As the httpd component is widely utilized across nearly every major Red Hat offering, a full listing of impacted packages will not be provided. Therefore, the “Affected Packages and Issued Red Hat Security Errata” section contains a simplified list of what offerings need to remediate this vulnerability. Every impacted offering has at least one representative component listed, but potentially not all of them.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
