    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the MiniZip component of the zlib package. When opening a new file, MiniZip doesn't properly validate the filename, comments, or extra fields length against the data type used to store this information. This may allow an attacker to craft a malicious ZIP file that will lead to an overflow on the length field. This value is further used in memory allocations and indexing, which can cause an out-of-bounds write, leading to heap corruption and possible arbitrary code execution. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Enterprise Linux default configuration doesn't expose zlib through any network services. Additionally, the user would need to be tricked into opening the crafted file from an attacker to be successful. The impact for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability is limited to the scope of the process and user privilege related to the victim, therefore, the impact is considered 'Low'.",
