		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in OpenSSL. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure through the SSL_select_next_proto function. This flaw allows an attacker to cause unexpected application behavior or a crash by exploiting the buffer overread condition when the function is called with a zero-length client list. This issue is only exploitable if the application is misconfigured to use a zero-length server list and mishandles the 'no overlap' response in ALPN or uses the output as the opportunistic protocol in NPN. \n            STATEMENT: The FIPS modules in versions 3.3, 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\nThe packages shim and shim-unsigned-x64 are not impacted by this CVE, as the affected OpenSSL code path is not utilized.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
