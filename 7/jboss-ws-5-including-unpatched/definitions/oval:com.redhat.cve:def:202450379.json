		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Tomcat. A Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition occurs during JSP compilation on case-insensitive file systems when the default servlet is enabled for writing. This vulnerability allows an uploaded file to be treated as a JSP and executed, resulting in remote code execution. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw can only be exploited when the `readonly` initialization parameter value is set to `false`, when running on case insensitive file systems and when the application is under load, specifically when read and upload operations are performed on the same file simultaneously. However, this issue still has an Important severity as it allows remote code execution without user interaction.\n\nThe default `readonly` initialization parameter value is `true` and not vulnerable to this issue.\n\nThe Tomcat package as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 is not affected by this vulnerability because the vulnerable code was introduced in a newer Tomcat version.\n\nRed Hat Satellite is not directed impacted by this issue as it does not include the affected Tomcat package. However, Tomcat is consumed by Candlepin, a component of Satellite. Red Hat Satellite users are advised to check the impact state of Red Hat Enterprise Linux as any necessary fixes will be distributed through the platform.\n            MITIGATION: Consider setting the readonly initialization parameter value to true (the default value), if that is not possible, do not use a case insensitive file system.",
