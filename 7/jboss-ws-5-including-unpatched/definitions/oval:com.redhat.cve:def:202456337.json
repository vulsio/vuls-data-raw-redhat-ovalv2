		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The fix for CVE-2024-50379 in Apache Tomcat was insufficient to mitigate the issue fully. A Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition occurs during JSP compilation on case-insensitive file systems when the default servlet is enabled for writing. This vulnerability allows an uploaded file to be treated as a JSP and executed, resulting in remote code execution. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability marked as Important rather than Moderate due to its potential to allow Remote Code Execution (RCE) when specific conditions are met, such as running on a case-insensitive file system with a misconfigured default servlet (`readonly=false`). RCE vulnerabilities are particularly important because they allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. Additionally, the dependency on file system behavior and Java runtime configurations adds complexity to mitigation, increasing the likelihood of exploitation in misconfigured environments.\n\nThe default `readonly` initialization parameter value is `true` and not vulnerable to this issue.\n\nThe Tomcat package as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 is not affected by this vulnerability because the vulnerable code was introduced in a newer Tomcat version.\n\nRed Hat Satellite is not directed impacted by this issue as it does not include the affected Tomcat package. However, Tomcat is consumed by Candlepin, a component of Satellite. Red Hat Satellite users are advised to check the impact state of Red Hat Enterprise Linux as any necessary fixes will be distributed through the platform.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
