		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: A flaw was found in HAProxy before 2.0.6. In legacy mode, messages featuring a transfer-encoding header missing the \"chunked\" value were not being correctly rejected. The impact was limited but if combined with the \"http-reuse always\" setting, it could be used to help construct an HTTP request smuggling attack against a vulnerable component employing a lenient parser that would ignore the content-length header as soon as it saw a transfer-encoding one (even if not entirely valid according to the specification). \n            STATEMENT: To exploit this vulnerability a vulnerable backend server is required. In particular the server should incorrectly parse the Transfer-Encoding HTTP header.\n\nThis issue did not affect the versions of haproxy as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and 7 as they did not include support for `http-reuse` option.\n            MITIGATION: - Reconsider the use of `http-reuse always` if possible\n- Disable HTTP Keep-Alive (also called HTTP Connection reuse) in the backend\n- Fix the backend server to correctly parse Transfer-Encoding/Content-Length headers",
