		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in nodejs-handlebars, where it is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution leading to Remote Code Execution. Templates may alter an Object's __proto__ and __defineGetter__ properties, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code through crafted payloads. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Quay includes Handlebars.js as a development dependency. It does not use Handlebars.js at runtime to process templates so it has been given a low impact rating.",
