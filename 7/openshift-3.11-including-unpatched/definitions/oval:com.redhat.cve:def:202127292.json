		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability was found in the npm library `ua-parser-js`. If a supplied user agent matches the `Noble` string and contains many spaces then the regex will conduct backtracking, taking an ever increasing amount of time depending on the number of spaces supplied. An attacker can use this vulnerability to potentially craft a malicious user agent resulting in a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: While some components do package a vulnerable version of ua-parser-js, access to them requires OpenShift OAuth credentials and hence have been marked with a Low impact. This applies to the following products:\n  - OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)\n  - OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) \n  - Red Hat OpenShift Jaeger (RHOSJ)\n  - Red Hat OpenShift Logging\n\nThe OCP presto-container does ship the vulnerable component, however since OCP 4.6 the Metering product has been deprecated [1], set as wont-fix and may be fixed in a future release.\n\nRed Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) ships graphql-tools that pulls 0.7.23 version of ua-parser-js that uses the affected code.\n\n[1] - https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5707561",
