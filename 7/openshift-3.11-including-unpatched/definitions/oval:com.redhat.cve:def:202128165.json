		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: When using SSL/TLS with Jetty, either with HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, or WebSocket, the server may receive an invalid large (greater than 17408) TLS frame that is incorrectly handled, causing high CPU resources utilization. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to service availability. \n            STATEMENT: In OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), the hive/presto/hadoop components that comprise the OCP metering stack, ship the vulnerable version of jetty.\nSince the release of OCP 4.6, the metering product has been deprecated [1], hence the affected components are marked as wontfix.\nThis may be fixed in the future.\n\n[1] https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/release_notes/ocp-4-6-release-notes.html#ocp-4-6-metering-operator-deprecated\n\nRed Hat OpenStack Platform's OpenDaylight will not be updated for this flaw because it was deprecated as of OpenStack Platform 14 and is only receiving security fixes for Important and Critical flaws.",
