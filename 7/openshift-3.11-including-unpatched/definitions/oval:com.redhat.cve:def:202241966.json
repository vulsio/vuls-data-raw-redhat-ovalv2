		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the xstream package. This flaw allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by injecting recursive collections or maps, raising a stack overflow. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Fuse 7 ships an affected version of XStream. No endpoint in any flavor of Fuse is accepting by default an unverified input stream passed directly to XStream unmarshaller. Documentation always recommend all the endpoints (TCP/UDP/HTTP(S)/other listeners) to have at least one layer of authentication/authorization and Fuse in general itself in particular has a lot of mechanisms to protect the endpoints.\n\nRed Hat Single Sign-On contains XStream as a transitive dependency from Infinispan and the same is not affected as NO_REFERENCE is in use.",
