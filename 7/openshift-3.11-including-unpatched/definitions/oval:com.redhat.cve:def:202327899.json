    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Jenkins. Jenkins creates a temporary file when a plugin is uploaded from an administratorâ€™s computer. If these permissions are overly permissive, they may allow attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system to read and write the file before it is installed in Jenkins, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution. \n            STATEMENT: OpenShift 3.11 is already in the ELS support model phase. The Jenkins components are out of the scope of the ELS support; hence OpenShift 3.11 Jenkins component is marked in this CVE as Out of Support Scope.",
