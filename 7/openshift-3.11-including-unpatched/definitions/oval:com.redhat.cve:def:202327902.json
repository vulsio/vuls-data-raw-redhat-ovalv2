		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Jenkins. Jenkins uses temporary directories adjacent to workspace directories, usually with the @tmp name suffix, to store temporary files related to the build. In pipelines, these temporary directories are adjacent to the current working directory when operating in a subdirectory of the automatically allocated workspace. Jenkins-controlled processes, like SCMs, may store credentials in these directories. Affected versions of Jenkins show these temporary directories when viewing job workspaces, which allows attackers with Item/Workspace permission to access their contents. \n            STATEMENT: OpenShift 3.11 is already in the ELS support model phase. The Jenkins components are out of the scope of the ELS support; hence OpenShift 3.11 Jenkins component is marked in this CVE as Out of Support Scope.",
