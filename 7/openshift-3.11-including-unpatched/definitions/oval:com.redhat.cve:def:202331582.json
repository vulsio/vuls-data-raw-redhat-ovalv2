		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Jose4J which allows a malicious user or internal person to erroneously set a low iteration count of 1000 or less to secure the Json Web Token. This could apply to lack of entropy and leave the system less secure. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw would require manually setting of the number of iterations under 1000 for Json Web Encryption, therefore, a malicious user would need previous access to modify it. Also, a user would still be able to set the variable incorrectly and make the environment less secure for JWE. This is currently rated as a moderate impact.\n            MITIGATION: No mitigation is currently available for this flaw.",
