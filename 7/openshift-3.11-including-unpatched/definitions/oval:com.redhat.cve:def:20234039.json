    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in GCC. The GCC's stack protection feature, enabled with the flag -fstack-protector, aims to detect buffer overflows in C/C++ function local variables that might allow an attacker to overwrite saved registers on the stack. If an attacker can modify saved register values, it may be possible for them to subvert program flow control. The feature operates by placing a canary value between local variables and saved registers on the stack on function entry and triggers an error handler on function exit if the canary value has been unexpectedly modified. \n\nWhen targeting AArch64, this feature did not protect the saved registers from overflows in C99-style dynamically-sized local variables and alloca() objects. Other local variables, including statically-sized local arrays, are not affected because of their different placement on the stack relative to saved registers. \n            STATEMENT: For Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes, the vulnerable GCC flags for ARM4 architecture are not used. Therefore, the impact is reduced to Low. However, external related projects could be potentially impacted.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
