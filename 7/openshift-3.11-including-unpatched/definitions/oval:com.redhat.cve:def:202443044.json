		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in the Remoting library in Jenkins core, which handles communication between the Jenkins controller and agents. The ClassLoaderProxy#fetchJar function may allow malicious agents or attackers with Agent/Connect permission to read arbitrary files from the Jenkins controller's file system due to insufficient path restrictions permissions, which could lead to Privilege Escalation and Remote Code Execution (RCE) \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability is classified as critical because it could allow remote code execution (RCE). Additionally, this vulnerability may enable an attacker to read arbitrary files from the Jenkins controller, resulting in a significant exposure of confidential information, compromising the overall integrity of the Jenkins instance.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
