		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: Jenkins 2.470 and earlier, LTS 2.452.3 and earlier allows agent processes to read arbitrary files from the Jenkins controller file system by using the `ClassLoaderProxy#fetchJar` method in the Remoting library. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability is classified as critical because it can lead to potential remote code execution (RCE). In Jenkins, vulnerabilities that an attacker can use to read arbitrary files from the controller could result in significant exposure of confidential information and compromise the overall integrity of the Jenkins instance.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
