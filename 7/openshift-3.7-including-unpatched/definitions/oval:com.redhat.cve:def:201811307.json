		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was discovered in jackson-databind where it would permit deserialization of a malicious object using MyBatis classes when using DefaultTyping. An attacker could use this flaw to achieve content exfiltration and possibly conduct further attacks.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Satellite 6 is not affected by this issue, since Candlepin's java runtime environment does not load MyBatis classes.\n\nRed Hat Virtualization 4 is not affected by this issue, since it does not include MyBatis classes.\n\nRed Hat Fuse 6 and 7 are not directly affected by this issue, as although they do ship the vulnerable jackson-databind component, they do not enable polymorphic deserialization or default typing which are required for exploitability. Their impacts have correspondingly been reduced to Moderate. Future updates may address this flaw.",
