    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Jenkins script security sandbox. The previously implemented script security sandbox protections prohibiting the use of unsafe AST transforming annotations such as @Grab could be circumvented through use of various Groovy language features including the use of AnnotationCollector, import aliasing, and referencing annotation types using their full class name. This allows users with Overall/Read permission, or the ability to control Jenkinsfile or sandboxed Pipeline shared library contents in SCM, to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity and system availability.\n            STATEMENT: This flaw affects the jenkins-2-plugins RPM which is installed in the openshift3/jenkins-2-rhel7 container image. Security updates for this image are only released for versions 3.11 and 4.x of OpenShift Container Platform. The 3.11 version of the openshift3/jenkins-2-rhel7 container image is supported for use with previous versions of OpenShift Container Platform up to 3.4. For more information, refer to the OpenShift Jenkins README:\n\nhttps://github.com/openshift/jenkins/blob/master/README.md#jenkins-security-advisories-the-master-image-from-this-repository-and-the-oc-binary",
