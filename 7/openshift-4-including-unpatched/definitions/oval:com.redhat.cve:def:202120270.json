    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: An infinite loop in SMLLexer in Pygments versions 1.5 to 2.7.3 may lead to denial of service when performing syntax highlighting of a Standard ML (SML) source file, as demonstrated by input that only contains the \"exception\" keyword. \n            STATEMENT: In OpenShift Container Platform 3.11, the vulnerable version of python-pygments is embedded in the google-cloud-sdk package, which is shipped in the openshift-ansible container (aos3-installation-container). As the access to the openshift-ansible container is restricted only to cluster administrators, this component is affected but with a Low impact. The google-cloud-sdk package was shipped in OpenShift Container Platform 4.1, which is End of Life.",
