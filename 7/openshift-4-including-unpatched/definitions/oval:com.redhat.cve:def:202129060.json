The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n            STATEMENT: OpenShift Service Mesh 1.1.x is in its maintenance phase, only Important and Critical vulnerabilities will be fixed at this time.\n\nIn OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) some components include the vulnerable color-string library, but access is protected by OpenShift OAuth what reducing impact by this flaw to LOW.\nStarting in OCP 4.7, the kibana component is shipping as \"container first\" content and as a part of the OpenShift Logging product (openshift-logging/kibana6-rhel8) and is not affected by this vulnerability. The kibana components delivered in OCP 4.6 and earlier are marked as `Out of support scope` because these versions are already under Maintenance Phase of the support.",
