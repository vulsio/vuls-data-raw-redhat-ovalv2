		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the gRPC lib. This vulnerability allows hpack table accounting errors that could lead to unwanted disconnects between clients and servers in exceptional cases. This issue leads to Unbounded memory buffering in the HPACK parser and Unbounded CPU consumption in the HPACK parser. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability is specific to C++ implementations of gRPC prior to the 1.57 release. The gRPC library was packaged with Openshift via the Kuryr component. However, Kuryr was never configured to run code using the gRPC library and has since been removed.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
