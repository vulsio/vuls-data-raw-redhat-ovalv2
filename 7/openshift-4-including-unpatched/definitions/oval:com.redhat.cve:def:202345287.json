		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Golang crypto/tls standard library. In previous versions, the package was vulnerable to a Timing Side Channel attack by observing the time it took for RSA-based TLS key exchanges, which was not constant. This flaw allows a malicious user to gather information from the environment. \n            STATEMENT: The identified flaw in the Golang crypto/tls library, is assessed as a moderate severity issue rather than important due to several mitigating factors. Although the vulnerability exposes a Timing Side Channel, potentially allowing information retrieval through RSA-based TLS key exchanges, its exploitation demands significant access and expertise. Additionally, while earlier versions implemented RSA blinding to counter timing attacks, the removal of PKCS#1 padding may still leak timing data. However, the practicality of exploiting this flaw is limited, and the transition to a fully constant time RSA implementation in Go 1.20 significantly bolsters security, reducing the risk posed by timing side channels.\n            MITIGATION: No current mitigation is available for this vulnerability.",
