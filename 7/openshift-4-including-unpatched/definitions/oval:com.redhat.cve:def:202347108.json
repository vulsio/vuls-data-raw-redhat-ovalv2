		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A memory exhaustion flaw was found in the otelgrpc handler of open-telemetry. This flaw may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to flood the peer address and port and exhaust the server's memory by sending multiple malicious requests, affecting the availability of the system. \n            STATEMENT: While no authentication is required, there are a significant number of non-default factors that prevent widespread exploitation of this issue. To affect a service, all of the following must be true:\n- The go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/google.golang.org/grpc/otelgrpc package must be in use\n- Configured a metrics pipeline that uses the UnaryServerInterceptor wrapper function\n- No filtering of unknown HTTP methods or user agents at a higher level, such as Content Delivery Network\n\nDue to the limited attack surface, Red Hat Product Security rates the impact of this flaw as Moderate.\n\ncluster-network-operator-container in Openshift Container Platform 4 is rated as low and Won't Fix as the stats are behind an RBAC proxy and isn't available to unauthenticated users.\n            MITIGATION: As a workaround, use a view removing the attributes. Another possibility is to disable grpc metrics instrumentation by passing otelgrpc.WithMeterProvider option with noop.NewMeterProvider.",
