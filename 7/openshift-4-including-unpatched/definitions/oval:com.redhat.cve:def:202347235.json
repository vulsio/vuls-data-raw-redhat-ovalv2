		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in frr. A crash can occur when a malformed BGP UPDATE message with an EOR is processed. Due to the presence of EOR, it does not lead to a treat-as-withdraw outcome. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat OpenStack Platform does not ship its own version of the frr package, instead using the version from the underlying Red Hat Enterprise Linux. RHOSP is marked as Not Affected as no changes need to be made by the OpenStack engineering team. System administrators of OpenStack deployments should apply updates once available in RHEL.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
