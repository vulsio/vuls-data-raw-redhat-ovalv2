		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Go language standard library net/netip. The method Is*() (IsPrivate(), IsPublic(), etc) doesn't behave properly when working with IPv6 mapped to IPv4 addresses. The unexpected behavior can lead to integrity and confidentiality issues, specifically when these methods are used to control access to resources or data. \n            STATEMENT: This CVE has been marked as moderate as for our products a network-based attack vector is simply impossible when it comes to golang code,apart from that as per CVE flaw analysis reported by golang, this only affects integrity and confidentiality and has no effect on availability, hence CVSS has been marked as such.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
