		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the bind9 package, where a client query triggers stale data and also requires local lookups may trigger a assertion failure. This issue results in a denial of service of the bind server. \n            STATEMENT: The discovered flaw in the BIND9 package is of high severity due to its dual impact on DNS server functionality and stability. The issue where client queries trigger the return of stale data undermines the integrity and reliability of DNS responses, potentially leading to incorrect or outdated information being served to clients. This can cause significant disruptions in services reliant on accurate DNS resolutions. Moreover, the assertion failure triggered by local lookups poses a critical threat, as it can crash the BIND server, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). Such an outage disrupts DNS operations, impacting network availability and access to internet services.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
