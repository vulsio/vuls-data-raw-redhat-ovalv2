		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the package_index module of pypa/setuptools. Affected versions of this package allow remote code execution via its download functions. These functions, which are used to download packages from URLs provided by users or retrieved from package index servers, are susceptible to code injection. If these functions are exposed to user-controlled inputs, such as package URLs, they can execute arbitrary commands on the system. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat OpenStack does not include setuptools. The ImcSdk component uses it only during compile time in our build systems, and we do not support recompiling SRPMs. As a result, Red Hat OpenStack is not affected by this flaw.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
