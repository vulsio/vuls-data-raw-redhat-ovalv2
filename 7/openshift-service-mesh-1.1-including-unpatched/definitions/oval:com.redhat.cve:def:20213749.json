		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability was found in the nodejs axios. This flaw allows an attacker to provide crafted input to the trim function, which might cause high resources consumption and as a consequence lead to denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is system availability. \n            STATEMENT: * OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) grafana-container does package a vulnerable version of nodejs axios. However, due to the instance being read only and behind OpenShift OAuth, the impact of this vulnerability is Low.\n\n* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) 2.1 and previous versions does contain a vulnerable version of nodejs axios, RHACM 2.2 on towards are not affected versions. For RHACM 2.1, due to the instance being read only and behind OAuth, the impact of this vulnerability is Low.\n\n* Because Service Telemetry Framework 1.2 will be retiring soon and the flaw's impact is lower, no update will be provided at this time for STF's service-telemetry-operator-container and smart-gateway-operator-container.",
