    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: In Apache Thrift all versions up to and including 0.12.0, a server or client may run into an endless loop when feed with specific input data. Because the issue had already been partially fixed in version 0.11.0, depending on the installed version it affects only certain language bindings. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat OpenStack Platform ships OpenDaylight, which contains a vulnerable version of libthrift. However, OpenDaylight does not expose libthrift in a vulnerable way, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for OpenDaylight. As such, Red Hat will not be providing a fix for OpenDaylight at this time.\n\nThe thrift package in OpenShift Container Platform is installed only in Curator images in the Logging stack. The affected code is included in this package, it's functionality is not used. This vulnerability is therefore rated Low for OpenShift Container Platform.",
