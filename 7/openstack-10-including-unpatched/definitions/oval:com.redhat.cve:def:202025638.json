    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in hibernate-core in versions prior to and including 5.4.23.Final. A SQL injection in the implementation of the JPA Criteria API can permit unsanitized literals when a literal is used in the SQL comments of the query. This flaw could allow an attacker to access unauthorized information or possibly conduct further attacks. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity. \n            STATEMENT: For Red Hat Process Automation Manager and Red Hat Decision Manager, the kie-server-ee7 zip is primarily for Weblogic/Websphere which is decided to stay on hibernate 5.1.x, it's not possible to make an upgrade to 5.3.x due to technical reasons. For this reason this fix is included only for kie-server-ee7. For this reason there are two components for RHPAM and RHDM.\n            MITIGATION: Set hibernate.use_sql_comments to false, which is the default value, or use named parameters instead of literals. Please refer to details in https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#configurations-logging and https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#sql-query-parameters.",
