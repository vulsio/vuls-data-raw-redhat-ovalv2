		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was discovered in MongoDB, where an update operation on a user-define role clears the authenticationRestrictions field that was previously set. This unexpected behavior may remove previous IP based restrictions configured on a role, thus allowing a user to bypass them once the update operation is performed. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Satellite 6.6 onward does not ship the MongoDB package; however, the product consumes MongoDB from Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Satellite has no plans to update to a version of MongoDB released with a Server Side Public License (SSPL) which includes all versions released after October 16, 2018. Refer to this article for more information: https://access.redhat.com/articles/5767021\n\nThis issue did not affect the versions of mongodb as shipped with Red Hat Update Infrastructure 3 as they did not include support for authenticationRestrictions field in roles.\n            MITIGATION: There is no known mitigation for this issue, the flaw can only be resolved by applying updates.",
