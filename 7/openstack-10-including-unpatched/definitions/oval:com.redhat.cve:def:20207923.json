		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in mongodb. A user authorized to perform database queries may cause denial of service by issuing specially crafted queries, which violate an invariant in the query subsystem's support for geoNear. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Satellite 6.6 onward does not ship the MongoDB package; however, the product consumes MongoDB from Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Satellite has no plans to update to a version of MongoDB released with a Server Side Public License (SSPL) which includes all versions released after October 16, 2018. Refer to this article for more information: https://access.redhat.com/articles/5767021\n\nRed Hat Update Infrastructure 3 ships an affected version of mongodb, however it does not use GeoQuery and it is not vulnerable to this flaw.",
