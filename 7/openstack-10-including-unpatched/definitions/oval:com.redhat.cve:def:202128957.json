		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in python-lxml. The HTML5 formaction attribute is not input sanitized like the HTML action attribute is which can lead to a Cross-Site Scripting attack (XSS) when an application uses python-lxml to sanitize user inputs. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. \n            STATEMENT: Web applications vulnerable to this flaw, where a XSS attack can be accomplished, are only those that use python-lxml to sanitize HTML input and that allow user data to be placed in the \"formaction\" attribute of a form button.\n\nIn Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact and the package is unlikely to be exploited in the RHOSP environment, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP python-lxml package.\n\nFor Ansible Tower and Ansible Automation Platform,  Lowering the impact from Moderate to Low as the vulnerable function i.e. lxml HTML Cleaner and the vulnerable attribute i.e. HTML FormAction are not being used.",
