    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Apache Tomcat. When Tomcat was configured to use NIO+OpenSSL or NIO2+OpenSSL for TLS, a specially crafted packet can trigger an infinite loop, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. \n            STATEMENT: In Red Hat Certificate System versions 9 and older, the version of Tomcat used is not affected by this flaw.\nIn Red Hat Certificate System 10, Tomcat is affected by this flaw. However, Tomcat is configured so that it does not use OpenSSLEngine, but the Dogtag JSS SSL implementation. As a result, the flaw can not be reached.",
