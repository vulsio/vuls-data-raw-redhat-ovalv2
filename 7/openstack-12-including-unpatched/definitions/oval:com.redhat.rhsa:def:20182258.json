		"description": "KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for\nLinux on a variety of architectures. The qemu-kvm-rhev packages provide the\nuser-space component for running virtual machines that use KVM in\nenvironments managed by Red Hat products.\n\nSecurity fix(es):\n* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor\ndesigns have implemented speculative execution of Load & Store instructions\n(a commonly used performance optimization). It relies on the presence of a\nprecisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as\nthe fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has\noccurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the\nmicroprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions\nthat never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker\ncould use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache\nside-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3639)\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Ken Johnson (Microsoft Security Response Center)\nand Jann Horn (Google Project Zero) for reporting this issue.\n\nNote: This is the qemu-kvm-rhev side of the CVE-2018-3639 mitigation that\nincludes support for guests running on hosts with AMD processors.\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS\nscore, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in\nthe References section.",
