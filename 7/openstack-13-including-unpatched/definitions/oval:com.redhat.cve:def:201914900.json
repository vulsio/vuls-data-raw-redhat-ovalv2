		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Hibernate ORM. A SQL injection in the implementation of the JPA Criteria API can permit unsanitized literals when a literal is used in the SELECT or GROUP BY parts of the query. This flaw could allow an attacker to access unauthorized information or possibly conduct further attacks. \n            STATEMENT: OpenDaylight:\nIn RHOSP10, RHOSP13 and RHOSP14 editions of Red Hat OpenStack platform, the hibernate-jfa library shipped with OpenDaylight is contains a flaw in the processing of SQL queries. The hibernate-jha implemenation is not used in a vulnerable way in OpenDaylight, preventing the potential for SQL injection.\n\nRed Hat Satellite 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 contains affected versions of hibernate-core in its candlepin component. However, that component does not use hibernate-core in a vulnerable way.\n            MITIGATION: There is no currently known mitigation for this flaw.",
