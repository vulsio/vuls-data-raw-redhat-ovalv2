		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in redis. An integer overflow bug could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. \n            STATEMENT: redis:6/redis and redis:5/redis shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 are not affected by this flaw as they do not ship vulnerable versions of Redis.\n\nThe versions of Redis provided by Red Hat OpenStack Platform are not directly affected by this issue. As a result the impact is lowered and no update will be provided at this time.\n            MITIGATION: The flaw can be mitigated by disallowing usage of the CONFIG SET command via ACL configuration. This will prevent clients from setting the set-max-intset-entries configuration parameter. Please see https://redis.io/topics/acl for more information on how to do this.",
