		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the HSQLDB package. This flaw allows untrusted inputs to execute remote code due to any static method of any Java class in the classpath, resulting in code execution by default. \n            \n            MITIGATION: By default, the static methods of any class that is on the classpath are available for use and can compromise security in some systems. The optional Java system property, hsqldb.method_class_names, allows preventing access to classes other than java.lang.Math or specifying a semicolon-separated list of allowed classes. A property value that ends with .* is treated as a wild card and allows access to all class or method names formed by substitution of the * (asterisk).\n\nIn the example below, the property has been included as an argument to the Java command.\n\n java -Dhsqldb.method_class_names=\"org.me.MyClass;org.you.YourClass;org.you.lib.*\" [the rest of the command line]\n\nThe above example allows access to the methods in the two classes: org.me.MyClass and org.you.YourClass together with all the classes in the org.you.lib package. Note that if the property is not defined, no access control is performed at this level.\n\nThe user who creates a Java routine must have the relevant access privileges on the tables that are used inside the Java method.\n\nOnce the routine has been defined, the normal database access control applies to its user. The routine can be executed only by those users who have been granted EXECUTE privileges on it. Access to routines can be granted to users with GRANT EXECUTE or GRANT ALL. For example, GRANT EXECUTE ON myroutine TO PUBLIC.\n\nIn hsqldb 2.7.1, all classes by default are not accessible, except those in java.lang.Math and need to be manually enabled.",
