		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: Ansible was logging at the DEBUG level which lead to a disclosure of credentials if a plugin used a library that logged credentials at the DEBUG level. This flaw does not affect Ansible modules, as those are executed in a separate process. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Gluster Storage no more maintains its own version of Ansible, pre-requisite is to enable ansible repository. The fix will be consumed from core Ansible.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
