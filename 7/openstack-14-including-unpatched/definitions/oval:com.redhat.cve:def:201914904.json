		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the solaris_zone module from the Ansible Community modules. When setting the name for the zone on the Solaris host, the zone name is checked by listing the process with the 'ps' bare command on the remote machine. An attacker could take advantage of this flaw by crafting the name of the zone and executing arbitrary commands in the remote host. \n            STATEMENT: Because a flaw exploit would depend on the use of Solaris and Red Hat does not support RHOSP on Solaris, the RHOSP Ansible package will not be updated at this time.\n\nAnsible Engine 2.7.15, 2.8.7, and 2.9.2 as well as previous versions are affected.\n            MITIGATION: Currently, there is no mitigation for this issue.",
