    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: An infinite-loop issue was found in the QEMU emulator built with USB EHCI emulation support. The flaw occurred during communication between the host controller interface(EHCI) and a respective device driver. These two communicate using an isochronous transfer descriptor list(iTD); an infinite loop unfolded if there was a closed loop in the list. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to consume excessive resources and cause denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: This issue does not affect the versions of the kvm and xen packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\n\nThis issue affects the versions of the qemu-kvm packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 based versions of qemu-kvm-rhev packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.\n\nThis issue affects the versions of the qemu-kvm packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nThis issue affects the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 based versions of the qemu-kvm-rhev packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.\n\nThis has been rated as having Low security impact and is not currently\nplanned to be addressed in future updates.
