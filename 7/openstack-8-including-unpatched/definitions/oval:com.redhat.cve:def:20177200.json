    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: The copy_from feature in Image Service API v1 allows an attacker to perform masked network port scans. It is possible to create images with a URL such as 'http://localhost:22'. This could allow an attacker to enumerate internal network details while appearing masked, because the scan appears to originate from the Image Service. This is classified as a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Note: Some knowledge of the internal network might be necessary to exploit this flaw internally (apart from localhost). \n            STATEMENT: Because the Image Service APIv1 was deprecated in Newton and because a workaround is possible, no fix is being made available.\n\nFor impacted products and the recommended mitigation, see the Knowledge Base article for this issue:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/2999581",
