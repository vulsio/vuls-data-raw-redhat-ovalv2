    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: The SingleDocParser::HandleFlowSequence function in yaml-cpp (aka LibYaml-C++) 0.6.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack consumption and application crash) via a crafted YAML file. \n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the versions of rh-mongodb32-yaml-cpp, rh-mongodb34-yaml-cpp, and rh-mongodb36-yaml-cpp as shipped with Red Hat Software Collections. However, this is only used to parse configuration files.\n\nRed Hat Satellite 6.5 ship yaml-cpp however has been rated as a security impact of Low, product version Satellite 6.6 onward is not affected. Satellite 6.5 is in Maintenance Support phase of the product life cycle and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.
