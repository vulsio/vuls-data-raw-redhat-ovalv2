		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in etcd. Certain directory paths are created with restricted access permissions (700) by using the os.MkdirAll. This function does not perform any permission checks when a given directory path exists already.\n            STATEMENT: In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) the affected components are behind OpenShift OAuth authentication. This restricts access to the vulnerable etcd to authenticated users only, therefore the impact by this vulnerability is Low.\nA similar access restriction is in place in Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) as etcd is limited to use within the internal API network, which is not accessible to any OpenStack tenants.",
