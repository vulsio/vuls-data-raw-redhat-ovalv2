    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: An improper limitation of path name flaw was found in containernetworking/cni. When specifying the plugin to load in the `type` field in the network configuration, it is possible to use special elements such as \"../\" separators to reference binaries elsewhere on the system. This flaw allows an attacker to execute other existing binaries other than the cni plugins/types, such as `reboot`. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. \n            STATEMENT: OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) does package a vulnerable version of containernetworking/cni, however, the NetworkDefinitionAttachment is defined in code and cannot be easily changed except through a user who has access to the operator namespace such as cluster-admin. As such, for OSSM, the impact is Low.",
