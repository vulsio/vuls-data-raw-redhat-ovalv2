    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Go. The LookupCNAME, LookupSRV, LookupMX, LookupNS, and LookupAddr functions in the net package and methods on the Resolver type, may return arbitrary values retrieved from DNS, allowing injection of unexpected contents. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity. \n            STATEMENT: * Since OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 is in Maintenance Phase of the support, only Important and Critical severity vulnerabilities will be addressed at this time.\n\n* For Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the golang-qpid-apache package.\n\n* In Service Telemetry Framework, because the flaw has a lower impact and the package is not directly used by STF, no updates will be provided at this time for the STF containers.",
