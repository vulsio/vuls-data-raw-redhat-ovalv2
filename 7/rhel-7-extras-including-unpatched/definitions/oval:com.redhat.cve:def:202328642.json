		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in runc. This vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions and create a symbolic link inside a container to the /proc directory, bypassing AppArmor and SELinux protections. \n            STATEMENT: The symlink vulnerability in runc allowing for the bypassing of AppArmor protections by manipulating the /proc symlink poses a moderate severity issue due to its potential impact on container isolation and security boundaries. While the exploitation requires specific mount configurations and access to the container's filesystem, it can lead to unauthorized access to host resources and potential privilege escalation within the containerized environment. This could enable attackers to compromise the integrity and confidentiality of other containers or the host system. Although the vulnerability does not allow direct remote code execution, its exploitation can result in significant security risks within containerized infrastructures, warranting a moderate severity rating.\n            MITIGATION: Avoid using an untrusted container image.",
