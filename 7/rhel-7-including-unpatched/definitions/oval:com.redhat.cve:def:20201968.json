		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in openssl in versions 1.0.2 to 1.0.2w. A Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to an attacker being able to compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS connection. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. \n            STATEMENT: openssl 1.1.0i as bundled in the ovmf package shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 supplementary rpms is not affected by this flaw. openssl 1.1.1 as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is also not affected.\n\nRed Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes does not use the vulnerable cipher suites, so it is not impacted by this flaw.\n            MITIGATION: In OpenSSL 1.0.2e and below, this flaw can be mitigated by not enabling any ciphersuites with Diffie Hellman (DH), excluding ciphersuites using Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH).\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.0.2f and above, this flaw can be mitigated by not enabling static DH ciphersuites. Such ciphersuites start with `DH-` in OpenSSL and are mapped to IANA names that start with `TLS_DH_`, excluding ciphersuites that start with `TLS_DH_anon`. Following this convention, we see that `DH-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384` with IANA name `TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384` is affected and should not be used in a mitigation of this flaw. However, `ECDH-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256`  with IANA name `TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` is not affected and may be used in a mitigation to this flaw, as it does not follow the `DH-` or `TLS_DH_` naming convention.",
