		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in libvpx, a library used to process VP9 video codecs data. This issue occurs when processing certain specially formatted video data via a crafted HTML page, allowing an attacker to crash or remotely execute arbitrary code in an application, such as a web browser that is compiled with this library. \n            STATEMENT: This security issue has been classified as having an Important security impact. Desktop users are at a high risk of exploitation of this flaw with very minimal interaction. It may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of resources.\n\nCustomers using this application, which does server-side video codecs by linking to the libvpx library, are also potentially impacted by this flaw and are advised to update to the fixed versions of the package.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
