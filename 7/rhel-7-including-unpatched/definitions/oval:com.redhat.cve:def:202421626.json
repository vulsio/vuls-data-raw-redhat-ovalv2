		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A file descriptor leak issue was found in the runc package. While a user performs `O_CLOEXEC` all file descriptors before executing the container code, the file descriptor is open when performing `setcwd(2)`, which means that the reference can be kept alive in the container by configuring the working directory to be a path resolved through the file descriptor. The non-dumpable bit is unset after `execve`, meaning there are multiple ways to attack this other than bad configurations. The only way to defend against it entirely is to close all unneeded file descriptors. \n            STATEMENT: The severity of this vulnerabilities in runc, ranging from unauthorized access to host filesystems to potential host binary overwrites, underscores the critical nature of the issue. These vulnerabilities not only enable malicious actors to escape containerized environments but also allow for full control over the underlying host system. With the widespread adoption of containerization technologies in both development and production environments, such exploits pose significant risks to data integrity, confidentiality, and system stability.\n            MITIGATION: There are no software countermeasures to mitigate this vulnerability. However, Dockerfiles can be inspected on the RUN and WORKDIR directives to ensure that there are no escapes or malicious paths - that are an indication of compromise. Lastly, limiting access and using only trusted container images can help prevent unauthorized access and malicious attacks.",
