		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the ISO-2022-CN-EXT plugin for glibc's iconv library. When converting from UCS4 charset, adding certain escape charterers is required to indicate where the charset was changed to the library. During this process, iconv improperly checks the boundaries of internal buffers, leading to a buffer overflow, which allows writing up to 3 bytes outside the desired memory location. This issue may allow an attacker to craft a malicious characters sequence that will trigger the out-of-bounds write and perform remote code execution, presenting a high impact to the Integrity, Confidentiality, and Availability triad. \n            STATEMENT: The described vulnerability in the iconv() function of GNU C Library, particularly affecting ISO-2022-CN-EXT character set conversions, poses a important severity issue due to its potential for out-of-bound writes. Such buffer overflows can lead to arbitrary memory corruption, which can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code, crash applications, or overwrite critical data structures, including neighboring variables. Given that the overflow can occur with specific, predictable values through SS2designation and SS3designation escape sequences, an attacker could craft malicious input to specifically trigger these overflows. Exploitation of this vulnerability could result in denial of service, privilege escalation, or even remote code execution, posing a significant threat to the security and integrity of affected systems.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
