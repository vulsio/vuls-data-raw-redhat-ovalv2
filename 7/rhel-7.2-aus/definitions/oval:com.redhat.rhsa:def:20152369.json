    "description": "OpenHPI is an open source project created with the intent of providing an\nimplementation of the SA Forum's Hardware Platform Interface (HPI).\nHPI provides an abstracted interface to managing computer hardware,\ntypically for chassis and rack based servers. HPI includes resource\nmodeling, access to and control over sensor, control, watchdog, and\ninventory data associated with resources, abstracted System Event Log\ninterfaces, hardware events and alerts, and a managed hotswap interface.\n\nIt was found that the \"/var/lib/openhpi\" directory provided by OpenHPI used\nworld-writeable and world-readable permissions. A local user could use this\nflaw to view, modify, and delete OpenHPI-related data, or even fill up the\nstorage device hosting the /var/lib directory. (CVE-2015-3248)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Marko Myllynen of Red Hat.\n\nThe openhpi packages have been upgraded to upstream version 3.4.0, which\nprovides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.\n(BZ#1127908)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* Network timeouts were handled incorrectly in the openhpid daemon. As a\nconsequence, network connections could fail when external plug-ins were\nused. With this update, handling of network socket timeouts has been\nimproved in openhpid, and the described problem no longer occurs.\n(BZ#1208127)\n\nAll openhpi users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncorrect these issues and add these enhancements.",
