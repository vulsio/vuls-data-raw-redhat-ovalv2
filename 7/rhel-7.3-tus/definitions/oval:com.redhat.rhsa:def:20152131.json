		"description": "OpenLDAP is an open-source suite of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\n(LDAP) applications and development tools. LDAP is a set of protocols used\nto access and maintain distributed directory information services over an\nIP network. The openldap packages contain configuration files, libraries,\nand documentation for OpenLDAP.\n\nA flaw was found in the way OpenLDAP parsed OpenSSL-style cipher strings.\nAs a result, OpenLDAP could potentially use ciphers that were not intended\nto be enabled. (CVE-2015-3276)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Martin Poole of the Red Hat Software\nMaintenance Engineering group.\n\nThe openldap packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2.4.40, which\nprovides a number of bug fixes and one enhancement over the previous\nversion:\n\n* The ORDERING matching rules have been added to the ppolicy attribute type\ndescriptions.\n* The server no longer terminates unexpectedly when processing SRV records.\n* Missing objectClass information has been added, which enables the user to\nmodify the front-end configuration by standard means.\n\n(BZ#1147982)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, OpenLDAP did not properly handle a number of simultaneous\nupdates. As a consequence, sending a number of parallel update requests to\nthe server could cause a deadlock. With this update, a superfluous locking\nmechanism causing the deadlock has been removed, thus fixing the bug.\n(BZ#1125152)\n\n* The httpd service sometimes terminated unexpectedly with a segmentation\nfault on the libldap library unload. The underlying source code has been\nmodified to prevent a bad memory access error that caused the bug to occur.\nAs a result, httpd no longer crashes in this situation. (BZ#1158005)\n\n* After upgrading the system from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 to Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 7, symbolic links to certain libraries unexpectedly\npointed to locations belonging to the openldap-devel package. If the user\nuninstalled openldap-devel, the symbolic links were broken and the \"rpm -V\nopenldap\" command sometimes produced errors. With this update, the symbolic\nlinks no longer get broken in the described situation. If the user\ndowngrades openldap to version 2.4.39-6 or earlier, the symbolic links\nmight break. After such downgrade, it is recommended to verify that the\nsymbolic links did not break. To do this, make sure the yum-plugin-verify\npackage is installed and obtain the target libraries by running the \"rpm -V\nopenldap\" or \"yum verify openldap\" command. (BZ#1230263)\n\nIn addition, this update adds the following enhancement:\n\n* OpenLDAP clients now automatically choose the Network Security Services\n(NSS) default cipher suites for communication with the server. It is no\nlonger necessary to maintain the default cipher suites manually in the\nOpenLDAP source code. (BZ#1245279)\n\nAll openldap users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncorrect these issues and add this enhancement.",
