    "description": "The libvirt library is a C API for managing and interacting with the\nvirtualization capabilities of Linux and other operating systems.\nIn addition, libvirt provides tools for remote management of\nvirtualized systems.\n\nIt was found that when the VIR_DOMAIN_XML_MIGRATABLE flag was used, the\nQEMU driver implementation of the virDomainGetXMLDesc() function could\nbypass the restrictions of the VIR_DOMAIN_XML_SECURE flag. A remote\nattacker able to establish a read-only connection to libvirtd could use\nthis flaw to leak certain limited information from the domain XML data.\n(CVE-2014-7823)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Eric Blake of Red Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, libvirt relies on the QEMU emulator to\nsupply the error message when an active commit is attempted. However, with\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 7, QEMU added support for an active commit, but an\nadditional interaction from libvirt to fully enable active commits is still\nmissing. As a consequence, attempts to perform an active commit caused\nlibvirt to become unresponsive. With this update, libvirt has been fixed to\ndetect an active commit by itself, and now properly declares the feature as\nunsupported. As a result, libvirt no longer hangs when an active commit is\nattempted and instead produces an error message.\n\nNote that the missing libvirt interaction will be added in Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 7.1, adding full support for active commits. (BZ#1150379)\n\n* Prior to this update, the libvirt API did not properly check whether a\nDiscretionary Access Control (DAC) security label is non-NULL before trying\nto parse user/group ownership from it. In addition, the DAC security label\nof a transient domain that had just finished migrating to another host is\nin some cases NULL. As a consequence, when the virDomainGetBlockInfo API\nwas called on such a domain, the libvirtd daemon sometimes terminated\nunexpectedly. With this update, libvirt properly checks DAC labels before\ntrying to parse them, and libvirtd thus no longer crashes in the described\nscenario. (BZ#1171124)\n\n* If a block copy operation was attempted while another block copy was\nalready in progress to an explicit raw destination, libvirt previously\nstopped regarding the destination as raw. As a consequence, if the\nqemu.conf file was edited to allow file format probing, triggering the bug\ncould allow a malicious guest to bypass sVirt protection by making libvirt\nregard the file as non-raw. With this update, libvirt has been fixed to\nconsistently remember when a block copy destination is raw, and guests can\nno longer circumvent sVirt protection when the host is configured to allow\nformat probing. (BZ#1149078)\n\nAll libvirt users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the\nupdated packages, libvirtd will be restarted automatically.",
