    "description": "The grep utility searches through textual input for lines that contain a\nmatch to a specified pattern and then prints the matching lines. The GNU\ngrep utilities include grep, egrep, and fgrep.\n\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way grep processed\ncertain pattern and text combinations. An attacker able to trick a user\ninto running grep on specially crafted input could use this flaw to crash\ngrep or, potentially, read from uninitialized memory. (CVE-2015-1345)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Prior to this update, the \\w and \\W symbols were inconsistently matched\nto the [:alnum:] character class. Consequently, using regular expressions\nwith \"\\w\" and \"\\W\" could lead to incorrect results. With this update, \"\\w\"\nis consistently matched to the [_[:alnum:]] character, and \"\\W\" is\nconsistently matched to the [^_[:alnum:]] character. (BZ#1159012)\n\n* Previously, the Perl Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) matcher\n(selected by the \"-P\" parameter in grep) did not work correctly when\nmatching non-UTF-8 text in UTF-8 locales. Consequently, an error message\nabout invalid UTF-8 byte sequence characters was returned. To fix this bug,\npatches from upstream have been applied to the grep utility. As a result,\nPCRE now skips non-UTF-8 characters as non-matching text without returning\nany error message. (BZ#1217080)\n\nAll grep users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues.",
