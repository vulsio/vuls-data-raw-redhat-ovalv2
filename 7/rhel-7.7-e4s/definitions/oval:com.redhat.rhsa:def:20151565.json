		"description": "The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's\nnetfilter connection tracking implementation loaded extensions. An attacker\non a local network could potentially send a sequence of specially crafted\npackets that would initiate the loading of a large number of extensions,\ncausing the targeted system in that network to crash. (CVE-2014-9715,\nModerate)\n\n* A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's early\nload microcode functionality. On a system with UEFI Secure Boot enabled, a\nlocal, privileged user could use this flaw to increase their privileges to\nthe kernel (ring0) level, bypassing intended restrictions in place.\n(CVE-2015-2666, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that the Linux kernel's ping socket implementation did not\nproperly handle socket unhashing during spurious disconnects, which could\nlead to a use-after-free flaw. On x86-64 architecture systems, a local user\nable to create ping sockets could use this flaw to crash the system.\nOn non-x86-64 architecture systems, a local user able to create ping\nsockets could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.\n(CVE-2015-3636, Moderate)\n\n* It was found that the Linux kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite implementation\nfor IPv6 allowed the Hop Limit value to be set to a smaller value than the\ndefault one. An attacker on a local network could use this flaw to prevent\nsystems on that network from sending or receiving network packets.\n(CVE-2015-2922, Low)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Nathan Hoad for reporting the CVE-2014-9715\nissue.\n\nThe kernel-rt packages have been upgraded to version 3.10.0-229.11.1, which\nprovides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version,\nincluding:\n\n* drbg: Add stdrng alias and increase priority\n* seqiv / eseqiv / chainiv: Move IV seeding into init function\n* ipv4: kABI fix for 0bbf87d backport\n* ipv4: Convert ipv4.ip_local_port_range to be per netns\n* libceph: tcp_nodelay support\n* ipr: Increase default adapter init stage change timeout\n* fix use-after-free bug in usb_hcd_unlink_urb()\n* libceph: fix double __remove_osd() problem\n* ext4: fix data corruption caused by unwritten and delayed extents\n* sunrpc: Add missing support for RPC_CLNT_CREATE_NO_RETRANS_TIMEOUT\n* nfs: Fixing lease renewal (Benjamin Coddington)\n* control hard lockup detection default\n* Fix print-once on enable\n* watchdog: update watchdog_thresh properly and watchdog attributes\n  atomically\n* module: Call module notifier on failure after complete_formation()\n\n(BZ#1234470)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* The megasas driver used the smp_processor_id() function within a\npreemptible context, which caused warning messages to be returned to the\nconsole. The function has been changed to raw_smp_processor_id() so that a\nlock is held while getting the processor ID. As a result, correct\noperations are now allowed without any console warnings being produced.\n(BZ#1235304)\n\n* In the NFSv4 file system, non-standard usage of the\nwrite_seqcount_{begin,end}() functions were used, which caused the realtime\ncode to try to sleep while locks were held. As a consequence, the\n\"scheduling while atomic\" error messages were returned. The underlying\nsource code has been modified to use the __write_seqcount_{begin,end}()\nfunctions that do not hold any locks, allowing correct execution of\nrealtime. (BZ#1235301)\n\nAll kernel-rt users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncorrect these issues and add these enhancements. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.",
