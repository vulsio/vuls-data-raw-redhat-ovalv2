		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in BouncyCastle. The number of iterations of the Miller-Rabin primality test was incorrectly calculated (according to FIPS 186-4 C.3). Under some circumstances, this could lead to the generation of weak RSA key pairs. \n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the versions of bouncycastle as shipped with Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager 1.x. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a security impact of Moderate. No update is planned for this product at this time. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.\n\nRed Hat Satellite 6.5 isn't vulnerable to this issue, since it doesn't ship bouncycastle jar file anymore.",
