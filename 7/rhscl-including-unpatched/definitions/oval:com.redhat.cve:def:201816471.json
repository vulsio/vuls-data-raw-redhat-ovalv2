    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: There is a possible XSS vulnerability in Rack before 2.0.6 and 1.6.11. Carefully crafted requests can impact the data returned by the `scheme` method on `Rack::Request`. Applications that expect the scheme to be limited to 'http' or 'https' and do not escape the return value could be vulnerable to an XSS attack. Note that applications using the normal escaping mechanisms provided by Rails may not impacted, but applications that bypass the escaping mechanisms, or do not use them may be vulnerable. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat OpenStack Platform and OpenShift Enterprise are not affected. Whilst the version of rack in use as a dependency in optional components is vulnerable, the vulnerable variable is not used in a way that could lead to XSS.\n\nSubscription Asset Manager is now in a reduced support phase receiving only Critical impact security fixes. This issue has been rated as having a security impact Moderate, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.\n\nRed Hat CloudForms and Satellite 6 are not affected. Whilst the version of rack in use as a dependency in optional components is vulnerable, the vulnerable variable is not used in a way that could lead to XSS.",
