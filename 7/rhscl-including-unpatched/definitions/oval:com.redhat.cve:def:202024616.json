    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x in versions prior to 2.9.10.6. The interaction between serialization gadgets and typing are mishandled. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability. \n            STATEMENT: The Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7 does ship the vulnerable component but has a mandatory whitelist which blocks all wicked serializing classes and does not enable the unsafe conditions needed to exploit.\n\nWhile OpenShift Container Platform's elasticsearch plugins do ship the vulnerable component, it doesn't do any of the unsafe things described in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3279231. We may update the jackson-databind dependency in a future release.\n\nThe PKI module as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and Red Hat Satellite 6 does not enable polymorphic deserialization which is a required configuration for the vulnerability to be used, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for the Product. We may update the jackson-databind dependency in a future release.\n\nRed Hat OpenStack Platform ships OpenDaylight, which contains the vulnerable jackson-databind. However, OpenDaylight does not expose jackson-databind in a way that would make it vulnerable, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for OpenDaylight. As such, Red Hat will not be providing a fix for OpenDaylight at this time.\n            MITIGATION: The following conditions are needed for an exploit, we recommend avoiding all if possible:\n* Deserialization from sources you do not control\n* `enableDefaultTyping()`\n* `@JsonTypeInfo using `id.CLASS` or `id.MINIMAL_CLASS`\n* avoid br.com.anteros.dbcp in the classpath",
