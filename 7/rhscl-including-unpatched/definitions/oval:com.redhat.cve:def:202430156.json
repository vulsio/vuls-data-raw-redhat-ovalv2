		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Varnish cache server, with HTTP/2 support enabled, that may allow a Denial of Service type of attack. A malicious actor can cause the server to run out of credits during the HTTP/2 connection control flow. As a consequence, the server will stop to properly process the active HTTP streams, retaining the already allocated resources, leading to resource starvation. \n            STATEMENT: CVE-2024-30156 represents a important severity issue due to its potential to cause widespread denial of service (DoS) across Varnish Cacher servers with HTTP/2 protocol enabled. By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can exhaust the server's HTTP/2 connection control flow window credits, thereby halting the processing of streams and indefinitely retaining associated resources. This can lead to a complete service outage, impacting the availability and performance of web services relying on Varnish Cache. Given the prevalence of HTTP/2 adoption for its performance benefits, the vulnerability poses a significant risk to web infrastructure, necessitating immediate mitigation measures to prevent exploitation and mitigate the impact on affected systems.\n            MITIGATION: A possible mitigation for this issue is to disable http2 support until the package can be updated.\nThis can be performed by running the following command:\n\n~~~\nvarnishadm param.set feature -http2\n~~~\n\nNote: you must remove `h2` from the list of protocols if your TLS terminator is advertising it with ALPN.\n\nIt's also possible to use the `MAIN.sc_bankrupt` counter to monitor possible on-going attacks to the varnish server.",
