		"description": "Cockpit is a Linux system adminstration tool with a web UI, easy setup, and minimal system footprint at runtime. When installed on hosts in Red Hat Virtualization, it provides monitoring and management functions beyond those available in the Administration Portal. Cockpit is installed by default on Red Hat Virtualization Host (RHVH).\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: cockpit-ovirt (0.13.5). (BZ#1705911, BZ#1711192, BZ#1719317, BZ#1723322)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* cockpit-ovirt: admin and appliance passwords saved in plain text variable file during HE deployment (CVE-2019-10139)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* In this release, the directory /var/lib/ovirt-hosted-engine-setup/cockpit is created with read permissions only for user 'root'. Non 'root' users cannot view this directory. (BZ#1723322)",
