    "description": "The redhat-virtualization-host packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks. \n\nThe ovirt-node-ng packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: redhat-release-virtualization-host (4.3.11), redhat-virtualization-host (4.3.11). (BZ#1868307, BZ#1878044)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* grub2: Crafted grub.cfg file can lead to arbitrary code execution during boot process (CVE-2020-10713)\n\n* QEMU: usb: out-of-bounds r/w access issue while processing usb packets (CVE-2020-14364)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.",
