    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: A flaw was found in PolicyKit (aka polkit) 0.115 that allows a user with a uid greater than INT_MAX to successfully execute any systemctl command. \n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the versions of polkit as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is now in Maintenance Support 2 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.\n\nThis issue affects the versions of polkit as shipped with Red Hat Virtualization 4. System users beyond those created at installation time are typically not used in Red Hat Virtualization Hypervisor or Management Appliance hosts, nor is there any opportunity to accidentally or maliciously create a user with a dangerous uid/gid on these systems under normal operation. For Red Hat Virtualization, this vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Low. Future updates may address this issue.\n            MITIGATION: Do not allow negative UIDs or UIDs greater than 2147483647.",
