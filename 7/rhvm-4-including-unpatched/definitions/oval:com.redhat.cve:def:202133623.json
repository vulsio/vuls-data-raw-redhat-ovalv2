    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in nodejs-trim-newlines. Node.js has an issue related to regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) for the .end() method. \n            STATEMENT: OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) grafana-container does package a vulnerable verison of nodejs trim-newlines. However due to the instance being read only and behind OpenShift OAuth, the impact by this vulnerability is Low. Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (ACM) containers affected by this flaw are only accessible to authenticated users, thus the impact of this vulnerability is Low. \nRed Hat Virtualization (RHV) does package a vulnerable version of nodejs-trim-newlines. However, no untrusted content is being parsed therefore the impact of this vulnerability is Low.\n\nThe hosted services are shipped with the vulnerable packages, however the vulnerable methods were not identified in use at this time.",
