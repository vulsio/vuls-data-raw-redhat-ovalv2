		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Django where it did not sanitize the email input from the password recovery form. An attacker with the knowledge of the victim user’s email address could use this flaw to reset the victim user’s password and retrieve the reset link to gain access and take over their account.\n            STATEMENT: This flaw depends upon the use of Django's password reset functionality. The following products ship the flawed code but do not use this functionality:\n* Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 and Red Hat Ceph Storage 3\n* Red Hat Gluster Storage 3\n* Red Hat Certified Cloud and Service Provider Certification 1\n* Red Hat OpenStack Platform, all versions\n* Red Hat Satellite 6, all versions\n            MITIGATION: Unless the password-reset form is disabled, this flaw can only be resolved by applying updates.",
