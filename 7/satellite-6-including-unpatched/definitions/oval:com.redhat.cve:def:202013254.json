		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Django, where the memcached backend does not perform key validation and passes malformed keys. This flaw causes a key collision and potential data leakage. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Satellite 6 ships affected python-django, however, it does not use memcached implementation in product code hence not vulnerable to this flaw.\n\nRed Hat Update Infrastructure 3 ships an affected version of python-django, however it does not use memcached as a cache backend and it is not vulnerable to this flaw.\n\nRed Hat Ceph Storage(RHCS) ships an affected version of python-django used with calamari and graphite which are no longer supported, hence the django package will not be fixed for RHCS.",
