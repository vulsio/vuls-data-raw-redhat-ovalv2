		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A open redirect flaw was found in the WSGI library python-werkzeug for a version before 0.11.6. When URL_PATH starts with a double slash followed by an arbitrary URL without scheme, python-werkzeug could redirect applications to that arbitrary URL. An attacker might use this technique to redirect victims to phishing websites controlled by an attacker or could use this flaw to chain vulnerabilities.\n            STATEMENT: python-werkzeug as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is not affected by this flaw because it ships a newer version of python-werkzeug. The version shipped with Red Hat Software Collections is also not affected as it does not contain the vulnerable code.\n\nRed Hat Satellite ships affected version of python-werkzeug, however, the product is not vulnerable because it does not use integrated development environment in production.",
