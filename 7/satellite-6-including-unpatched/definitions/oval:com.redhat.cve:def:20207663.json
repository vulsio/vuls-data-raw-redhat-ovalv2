		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the websocket-extensions ruby module in versions prior to 0.1.5. The parser may take quadratic time when parsing a header containing an unclosed string parameter value whose content is a repeating two-byte sequence of a backslash and another character. When abused by an attacker, a Regex denial of service on a single-threaded server could occur. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat CloudForms 4.7 (CFME 5.10) is in the maintenance phase and we will not be fixing Medium/Low impact security bugs. Reference: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/cloudforms\n\nRed Hat Satellite 6 ships affected RubyGem Websocket-extensions, however, product is not vulnerable to the flaw. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification",
