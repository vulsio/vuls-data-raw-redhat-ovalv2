		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in rubygem-activesupport. An untrusted user input can be written to the cache store using the `raw: true` parameter which can lead to the result being evaluated as a marshaled object instead of plain text. The threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the version of rubygem-activesupport as shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3. However, the 'raw' option is not used by the product when storing untrusted user input and hence this issue has been rated as having a security impact of Low.\n\nRed Hat Satellite ship affected RubyGem ActiveSupport and use RedisCacheStore, however, unmarshalling of user-provided objects is handled well in product code hence it is not vulnerable to the flaw. We may update the Ruby on Rails and rails-core dependency in a future release.\n\nin OpenShift Container Platform 3.11, rubygem-activesupport is shipped, and it's included in the logging-fluentd container for use by rubygem-kubeclient [1]. The kubeclient gem does NOT make use of the vulnerable class, its only included for the inflector part of activesupport.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
