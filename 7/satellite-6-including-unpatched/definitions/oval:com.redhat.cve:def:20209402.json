		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A SQL-injection flaw was found in python-django, where GIS functions and aggregates in Oracle did not correctly neutralize tolerance-parameter data. A remote attacker could use this flaw to submit crafted data to inject malicious SQL.\n            STATEMENT: Although the following products ship the flawed code, they do not use or support its functionality and therefore will not be updated:\n* Red Hat OpenStack Platform\n* Red Hat Update Infrastructure 3\n* Red Hat Ceph Storage\n\nThe following products will be updated. However, because both products do not use the functionality, their Impact has been reduced to 'Low':\n* Red Hat Gluster Storage\n* Red Hat Satellite 6\n            MITIGATION: There is no known mitigation for this issue, the flaw can only be resolved by applying updates.",
