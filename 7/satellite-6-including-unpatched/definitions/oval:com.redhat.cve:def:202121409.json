		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Netty. There is an issue where the content-length header is not validated correctly if the request uses a single Http2HeaderFrame with the endstream set to true. This flaw leads to request smuggling if the request is proxied to a remote peer and translated to HTTP/1.1. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Satellite ships a vulnerable Netty version embedded in Candlepin. However, it is not directly vulnerable since the HTTP requests are handled by Tomcat and not by Netty.\nRed Hat OpenStack Platform's OpenDaylight will not be updated for this flaw because it was deprecated as of OpenStack Platform 14 and is only receiving security fixes for Important and Critical flaws.\n\nIn OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), the Hive/Presto/Hadoop components that comprise the OCP Metering stack, ship the vulnerable version of netty-codec-http package.\nSince the release of OCP 4.6, the Metering product has been deprecated [1], hence the affected components are marked as wontfix.\nThis may be fixed in the future.",
