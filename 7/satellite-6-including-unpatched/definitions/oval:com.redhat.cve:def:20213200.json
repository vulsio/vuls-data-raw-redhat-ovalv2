    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in libsolv. A buffer overflow vulnerability could cause a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. \n            STATEMENT: It is not clear how this flaw could cause denial of service in most practical situations in general, and it is not the case in Red Hat Enterprise Linux package management, therefore we have lowered the Impact to Low. This is due to the fact that it is a small out of bounds read triggered by the testsolv program in the code used to evaluate testcases: https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv/blob/master/doc/testsolv.txt\n\nRed Hat Update Infrastructure 3.1 is in the maintenance phase and we will not be fixing Medium/Low impact security bugs.
