		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: The Snappy frame decoder function doesn't restrict the chunk length which may lead to excessive memory usage. Beside this it also may buffer reserved skippable chunks until the whole chunk was received which may lead to excessive memory usage as well. This vulnerability can be triggered by supplying malicious input that decompresses to a very big size (via a network stream or a file) or by sending a huge skippable chunk. \n            STATEMENT: In OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), the Hive/Presto/Hadoop components that comprise the OCP Metering stack, ship the vulnerable version of netty-codec package.\nSince the release of OCP 4.6, the Metering product has been deprecated [1], hence the affected components are marked as wontfix.\nThis may be fixed in the future.\n\nStarting in OCP 4.7, the elasticsearch component is shipping as a part of the OpenShift Logging product (openshift-logging/elasticsearch6-rhel8). The elasticsearch component delivered in OCP 4.6 is marked as `Out of support scope` because these versions are already under Maintenance Phase of the support.\n\n[1] https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/release_notes/ocp-4-6-release-notes.html#ocp-4-6-metering-operator-deprecated",
