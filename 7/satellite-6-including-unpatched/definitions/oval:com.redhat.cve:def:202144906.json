		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption flaw was found in minimist. This flaw allows an attacker to trick the library into adding or modifying the properties of Object.prototype, using a constructor or __proto__ payload, resulting in prototype pollution and loss of confidentiality, availability, and integrity. \n            STATEMENT: The original fix for CVE-2020-7598 was incomplete as it was still possible to bypass in some cases. While this flaw (CVE-2021-44906) enables attackers to control objects that they should not have access to, actual exploitation would still require a chain of independent flaws. Even though the CVSS for CVE-2021-44906 is higher than CVE-2020-7598, they are both rated as having Moderate impact.\n\nWithin Red Hat Satellite 6 this flaw has been rated as having a security impact of Low. It is not currently planned to be addressed there, as the minimist library is only included in the -doc subpackage and is part of test fixtures that are not in the execution path used by the rabl gem.",
