    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the SnakeYaml package. This flaw allows an attacker to benefit from remote code execution by sending malicious YAML content and this content being deserialized by the constructor. Deserialization is unsafe and leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE). \n            STATEMENT: In the Red Hat Process Automation 7 (RHPAM) the untrusted, malicious YAML file for deserialization by the vulnerable Snakeyaml's SafeConstructor class must be provided intentionally by the RHPAM user which requires high privileges. The potential attack complexity is also high because it depends on conditions that are beyond the attacker's control. Due to that the impact for RHPAM is reduced to Low.\n\nRed Hat Fuse 7 does not expose by default any endpoint that passes incoming data/request into vulnerable Snakeyaml's Constructor class nor pass untrusted data to this class. When this class is used, itâ€™s still only used to parse internal configuration, hence the impact by this vulnerability to Red Hat Fuse 7 is reduced to Moderate.",
