		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: qs before 6.10.3, as used in Express before 4.17.3 and other products, allows attackers to cause a Node process hang for an Express application because an __ proto__ key can be used. In many typical Express use cases, an unauthenticated remote attacker can place the attack payload in the query string of the URL that is used to visit the application, such as a[__proto__]=b&a[__proto__]&a[length]=100000000. The fix was backported to qs 6.9.7, 6.8.3, 6.7.3, 6.6.1, 6.5.3, 6.4.1, 6.3.3, and 6.2.4 (and therefore Express 4.17.3, which has \"deps: qs@6.9.7\" in its release description, is not vulnerable). \n            STATEMENT: - The qs and express Package is not used by the OpenShift Container Platform console directly and is only a third-party package dependency. Hence, marked it as wontfix.\n- In OpenShift Service Mesh, 'qs' is hoisted from storybook and node-sass, both are dev dependencies, and the vulnerability is not exposed to end users. Hence marked it as wontfix.",
