		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Moment.js package. Users who pass user-provided strings without sanity length checks to the moment constructor are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Fuse provides the affected software but does not use the functionality and as such its impact has been downgraded to Low.\n\nRed Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) ships a vulnerable version of the moment library. However, this affected functionality is restricted behind OAuth, reducing the impact to Moderate.\n\nRed Hat Satellite ships a vulnerable version of the moment library. However, this only affects a specific component (qpid-dispatch), reducing the impact to Moderate.\n\nRed Hat Ceph Storage (RHCS) ships a vulnerable version of the moment library, however, it is not directly used and is a transitive dependency from Angular. In addition, the impact would only be to the grafana browser, and not the underlying RHCS system, which reduces the impact to Moderate. \n\nRed Hat OpenShift Service Mesh (OSSM) ships a vulnerable version of the moment library, however, it is not directly used, and as such, the impact has been lowered to Moderate.\n\nRed Hat OpenShift distributed tracing ships a vulnerable version of the moment library, however, it is not directly used, and as such, the impact has been lowered to Moderate.\n\nIn Logging Subsystem for Red Hat OpenShift the vulnerable moment nodejs package is bundled in the ose-logging-kibana6 container as a transitive dependency, hence the direct impact is reduced to Moderate.\n\nIn OpenShift Container Platform 4 the vulnerabile moment package is a third party dependency, hence the direct impact is reduced to Moderate.",
