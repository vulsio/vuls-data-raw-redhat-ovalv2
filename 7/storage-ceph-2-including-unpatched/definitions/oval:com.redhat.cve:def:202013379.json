    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: An SSRF incorrect access control vulnerability was found in Grafana regarding the avatar feature, allowing any unauthenticated user or client to make Grafana send HTTP requests to any URL and then return its result to the user or client. Additionally, the same issue can create a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability. This flaw allows an attacker to gain information about the network that Grafana is running on, or cause a segmentation fault, resulting in a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: In both OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) and OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM), the Grafana containers are behind OpenShift OAuth restricting access to the vulnerable path to authenticated users only. However, other pods may still access the vulnerable URL within the cluster. Therefore the impact is moderate for both (OCP and OSSM).\n\nRed Hat Ceph Storage 2 is now in Extended Life Support (ELS) Phase of the support. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Ceph Storage Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/ceph-storage\n            MITIGATION: This issue can be mitigated by blocking access to the URL path /avatar/*, through a method such as a reverse proxy, load balancer, application firewall etc.",
