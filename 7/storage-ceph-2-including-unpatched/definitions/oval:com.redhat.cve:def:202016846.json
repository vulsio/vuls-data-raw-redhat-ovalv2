    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in salt. A shell injection vulnerability was found where an unauthenticated user with network access to the Salt API can use shell injections to run code on the Salt-API using the SSH client. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service, information disclosure, or privilege escalation. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 shipped salt for the usage of Red Hat Storage Console 2 (RHSCON-2), which required salt to administrate ceph nodes. RHSCON-2 has reached End Of Life, hence salt is no longer used and supported. Therefore, the salt package provided by Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 has been marked as 'will not fix'.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update as soon as possible.",
