    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in django. Staff members could use the :mod:`~django.contrib.admindocs` ``TemplateDetailView`` view to check the existence of arbitrary files. Additionally, if (and only if) the default admindocs templates have been customized by the developers to also expose the file contents, then not only the existence but also the file contents would have been exposed. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Update Infrastructure is in maintenance phase and we will not be fixing Medium/Low impact security bugs. Reference: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/rhui\n\nIn Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13, because the flaw has a lower impact and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP python-django package.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
