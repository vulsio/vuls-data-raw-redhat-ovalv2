    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in several ansible modules, where parameters containing credentials, such as secrets, were being logged in plain-text on managed nodes, as well as being made visible on the controller node when run in verbose mode. These parameters were not protected by the no_log feature. An attacker can take advantage of this information to steal those credentials, provided they have access to the log files containing them. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 no longer maintains its own version of ansible, prerequisite is to enable ansible repository in order to consume the latest version of ansible which has many bug and security fixes.",
