		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in macaron. Path URLs aren't cleaned before being redirected creating an open redirect in the static handler.\n            STATEMENT: This issue has a low impact on both OpenShift Container Platform and OpenShift Service Mesh grafana containers. As neither components make use of the Static handler the impact is Low. A future version of Grafana may use the Macaron Static handler so we may fix this in a future release.\n\nRed Hat Ceph Storage (RHCS) versions 3 and 4 use Grafana where the affected version of the macaron package is delivered. However the Static handler is not used by Ceph hence the impact by this vulnerability is Low. Ceph-2 has reached End of Extended Life Cycle Support and no longer fixing moderates/lows.",
