		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Ansible Engine when the fetch module is used. An attacker could intercept the module, inject a new path, and then choose a new destination path on the controller node.\n            STATEMENT: Ansible Engine 2.7.16, 2.8.10, and 2.9.6 as well as previous versions are affected.\n\nAnsible Tower 3.4.5, 3.5.5 and 3.6.3 as well as previous versions are affected.\n\nIn Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact,  ansible is not directly customer exposed, and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP ansible package.\n            MITIGATION: Currently, there is no mitigation for this issue except avoid using the affected fetch module when possible.",
