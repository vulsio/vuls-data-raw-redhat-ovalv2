		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in nodejs-prismjs. A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is possible via the prism-asciidoc, prism-rest, prism-tap and prism-eiffel components. \n            STATEMENT: OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)  and Red Hat Ceph Storage (RHCS) 3 and 4  grafana-container does package a vulnerable verison of prismjs. However due to the instance being read only and behind OpenShift OAuth, it has been given a Low impact. Additionally it has been marked as wont-fix at this time and may be fixed in a future release.\n\nOpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM)  ncludes a vulnerable version of prismjs. Due to the component being behind OpenShift OAuth and the vulnerability itself being limited to the syntax highlighting within grafana, it has been given a Low impact. The OSSM servicemesh-grafana component has been marked as wont-fix at this time and may be fixed in a future release.\n\nRed Hat Ceph Storage RHCS 3 and 4 grafana  includes a vulnerable version of prismjs, however, due to the vulnerability itself being limited to the syntax highlighting within grafana, it has been given a Low impact.  RHCS 3 and 4  have been marked as wont-fix at this time and may be fixed in a future release.",
