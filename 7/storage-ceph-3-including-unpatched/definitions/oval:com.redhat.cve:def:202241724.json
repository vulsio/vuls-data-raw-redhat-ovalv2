    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Golang Go, where it is vulnerable to a denial of service caused when processing large TLS handshake records. By sending specially-crafted TLS handshake records, a remote, authenticated attacker can cause a denial of service condition. \n            STATEMENT: The opportunity for a denial of service is limited to the golang runtime. In the case of the OpenShift Container Platform, this would be restricted within each individual container. There are multiple layers of guide rails (Golang’s Garbage Collector; OpenShift’s resource constraints imposed at the container and cluster levels) which would require a malicious user to continue submitting attacks for there to be any enduring impact. They would also need access to external server resources to be able to send a massive volume of requests to cause a significant impact on server operations.",
