    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw has been found in libuv. Node.js is vulnerable to out-of-bounds read in libuv's uv__idna_toascii() function which is used to convert strings to ASCII which is called by Node's DNS module's lookup() function and can lead to information disclosures or crashes. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. \n            STATEMENT: As distributed by Red Hat, a maximum of 3 bytes out of bound can be read. This would not be sufficient to crash nodejs or other applications using libuv, unless it was recompiled using an address sanitizer. The memory disclosure is also very limited.\n\nRed Hat Quay version 3.5 does not ship nodejs. Red Hat Quay version 3.4 consumes the nodejs from RHEL, so security tracking is provided by the container health index on the customer portal [1]. Additionally there is no impact from this issue on Quay 3.3 and 3.2 because they don't use nodejs as a HTTP server.\n[1] https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/quay/quay-rhel8/600e03aadd19c7786c43ae49?container-tabs=security",
