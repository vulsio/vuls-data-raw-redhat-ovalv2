		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Netty's netty-codec due to size restrictions for decompressed data in the Bzip2Decoder. By sending a specially-crafted input, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: In the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), the Hive/Presto/Hadoop components that comprise the OCP Metering stack ship the vulnerable version of netty-codec package. Since the release of OCP 4.6, the Metering product has been deprecated [1], so the affected components are marked as wontfix. This may be fixed in the future.\n\nStarting in OCP 4.7, the elasticsearch component is shipping as a part of the OpenShift Logging product (openshift-logging/elasticsearch6-rhel8). The elasticsearch component delivered in OCP 4.6 is marked as `Out of support scope` because these versions are already under Maintenance Phase of the support.\n\n[1] https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/release_notes/ocp-4-6-release-notes.html#ocp-4-6-metering-operator-deprecated",
