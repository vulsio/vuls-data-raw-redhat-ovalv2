Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of MySQL Connectors. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 8.3 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). \n            STATEMENT: This flaw has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate because it is difficult to exploit and requires user interaction.\n\nThe package mariadb Java client is available in Red Hat Software Collections. It can be installed this way:\n\n  # yum-config-manager --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms\n  # yum install rh-mariadb105-mariadb-java-client\n\nThis JDBC driver works fine with both MariaDB and MySQL servers. We recommend use of mariadb-java-client over mysql-java-connector where possible.",
