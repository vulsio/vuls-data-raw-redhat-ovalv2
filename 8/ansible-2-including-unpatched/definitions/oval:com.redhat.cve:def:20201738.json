		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Ansible Engine when the module package or service is used and the parameter 'use' is not specified. If a previous task is executed with a malicious user, the module sent can be selected by the attacker using the ansible facts file.\n            STATEMENT: Ansible Engine 2.7.16, 2.8.10, and 2.9.6 as well as previous versions are affected.\n\nAnsible Tower 3.4.5, 3.5.5 and 3.6.3 as well as previous versions are affected.\n\nIn Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact,  ansible is not directly customer exposed, and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP ansible package.\n            MITIGATION: Specify the parameter 'use' when possible on the package and service modules. Avoid using Ansible Collections on Ansible 2.8.9 or 2.7.16 (and any of the previous versions) as they are not rejecting python with no path (already fixed in 2.9.x).",
