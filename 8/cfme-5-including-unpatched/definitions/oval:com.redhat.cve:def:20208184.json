    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in rubygem-rack. An attacker may be able to trick a vulnerable application into processing an insecure (non-SSL) or cross-origin request if they can gain the ability to write arbitrary cookies that are sent to the application. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity. \n            STATEMENT: Because Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0 Operational Tools packages ships the flawed code, but does not use its functionality, its Impact has been reduced to 'Low'.\n\nRed Hat Satellite 6 and Red Hat CloudForms ship affected RubyGem Rack, however, since overwriting cookies is not possible products are not vulnerable to the flaw. We may update the Rack dependency in a future releases. \n\nRed Hat Gluster Storage 3 ships RubyGem Rack, but the version shipped does not contain the affected code. Therefore, it is impossible to overwrite cookies using this particular flaw.",
