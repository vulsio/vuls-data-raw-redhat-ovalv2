    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: It was discovered that podman resolves a symlink in the host context during a copy operation from the container to the host. An attacker could create a container image containing particular symlinks that, when copied by a victim user to the host filesystem, may overwrite existing files with others from the host. \n            STATEMENT: This issue did not affect the versions of podman as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 as they did not include support for the copy function.\n\nThis issue did not affect the versions of podman as shipped in OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 and 4.1 as they did not include support for the copy function.\n\nThe version of podman shipped in OpenShift Container Platform 4.2 was superseded by the version delivered Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.",
