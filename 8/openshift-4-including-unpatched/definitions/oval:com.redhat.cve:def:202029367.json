    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the blosc library. Depending on how the library is used, if there is a lack of space to write compressed data, an attacker can exploit this flaw to crash the program or potentially execute arbitrary code. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and system availability. \n            STATEMENT: OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4 temporarily shipped one version of the blosc package in OCP 4.3.0. Updates to the blosc package, which is used in the ironic-hardware-inventory-recorder-image container are consumed from OpenStack Platform 16 repositories.\n\nIn Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP blosc package.",
