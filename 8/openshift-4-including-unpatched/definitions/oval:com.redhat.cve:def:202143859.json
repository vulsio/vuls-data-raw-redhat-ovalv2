		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: XStream is an open source java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. Versions prior to 1.4.19 may allow a remote attacker to allocate 100% CPU time on the target system depending on CPU type or parallel execution of such a payload resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream. XStream 1.4.19 monitors and accumulates the time it takes to add elements to collections and throws an exception if a set threshold is exceeded. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade may set the NO_REFERENCE mode to prevent recursion. See GHSA-rmr5-cpv2-vgjf for further details on a workaround if an upgrade is not possible. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact and the issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, hence, marked as Out-of-Support-Scope.
