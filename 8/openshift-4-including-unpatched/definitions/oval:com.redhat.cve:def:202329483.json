		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The dnspython stub resolver is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) risk if an attacker sends a malicious response forged with the correct address and port before a legitimate one arrives on the UDP port used by dnspython for the query. In such cases, dnspython could either switch to another resolver or abandon the query altogether, potentially leading to service denial for that resolution. \n            STATEMENT: The vulnerability in dnspython where it may accept a malicious DNS response over a legitimate one due to timing issues poses a moderate severity risk. While the impact is limited to potential denial of service for DNS resolution requests, it requires precise timing and the ability to send malicious responses before legitimate ones arrive. This attack vector relies on the attacker's ability to predict or manipulate the timing of DNS responses, making it more complex to exploit compared to other vulnerabilities. However, if successfully exploited, it can disrupt DNS resolution services, affecting the availability of the targeted domain or service.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
