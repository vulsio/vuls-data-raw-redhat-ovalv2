		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in PyCryptodome/pycryptodomex which may allow for side-channel leakage when performing OAEP decryption, which could be exploited to carry out a Manger attack. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat OpenStack 16.1 and 16.2 versions include affected python-scciclient embedded through the python-crypto package, however, python-scciclient employs only one algorithm, which is AES. While the version of python-crypto we ship may be susceptible to a particular CVE, since affected algorithms are not utilized by OpenStack, the attack cannot be executed to exploit an OpenStack deployment",
