		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the rsync daemon which could be triggered when rsync compares file checksums. This flaw allows an attacker to manipulate the checksum length (s2length) to cause a comparison between a checksum and uninitialized memory and leak one byte of uninitialized stack data at a time. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability is rated as having Important impact as it helps bypass Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). ASLR is a memory protection system which makes the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities more difficult.\n            MITIGATION: Seeing as this vulnerability relies on information leakage coming from the presence of data in the uninitialized memory of the `sum2` buffer, a potential mitigation involves compiling rsync with the `-ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero` option set. This mitigates the issue because it initializes the `sum2` variable's memory with zeroes to prevent uninitialized memory disclosure.",
