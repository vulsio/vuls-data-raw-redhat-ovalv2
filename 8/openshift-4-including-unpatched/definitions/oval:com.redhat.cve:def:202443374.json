		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A heap use-after-free vulnerability was found in Vim's alist_add() function. Adding a new file to the argument list triggers Buf* autocommands. In an autocommand, if the buffer that was just opened is closed, including the window where it is shown, it causes the window structure to be freed, containing a reference to the argument list that is being modified. Once the autocommands are completed, references to the window and argument list are no longer valid, causing a use-after-free issue. To trigger this issue, a local attacker or user must add unusual autocommands that wipe a buffer during creation, either manually or by sourcing a malicious plugin, which will cause Vim to crash.",
