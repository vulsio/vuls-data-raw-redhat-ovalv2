		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Unbound. Malicious upstream responses with large Resource Record Sets (RRsets) can cause Unbound to spend considerable time applying name compression to downstream replies. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. This vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with large RRsets.",
