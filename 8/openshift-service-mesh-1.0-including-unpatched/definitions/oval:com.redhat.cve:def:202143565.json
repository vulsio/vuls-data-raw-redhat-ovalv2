    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: There's an input validation flaw in golang.org/x/crypto's readCipherPacket() function. An unauthenticated attacker who sends an empty plaintext packet to a program linked with golang.org/x/crypto/ssh could cause a panic, potentially leading to denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: go-toolset shipped with Red Hat Developer Tools - Compilers and golang shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 are not affected by this flaw because they do not ship the vulnerable code.\n\nThis flaw was rated to have a Moderate impact because it is not shipped in the Golang standard library and thus has a reduced impact to products compared with other flaws of this type.",
