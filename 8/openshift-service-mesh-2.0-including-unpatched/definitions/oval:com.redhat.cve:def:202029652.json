		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A null pointer dereference vulnerability was found in golang. When using the library's ssh server without specifying an option for GSSAPIWithMICConfig, it is possible for an attacker to craft an ssh client connection using the `gssapi-with-mic` authentication method and cause the server to panic resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. \n            STATEMENT: A large number of products include the affected package, but do not make use of the vulnerable SSH server code.  Accordingly, the flaw itself is rated as \"Important\", but these products themselves all have a \"Low\" severity rating.\n\nAdditionally, a number of products include golang.org/x/crypto (or even golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal) but not specifically golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/server.go in the final build. As this would result in a very large number of entries of not affected products, only products which include the ssh server code (golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/server.go) have been represented here.  \n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 8 container-tools:rhel8/containernetworking-plugins is not affected because although it uses some functionality from golang.org/x/crypto, it does not use or import anything from golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/*.",
