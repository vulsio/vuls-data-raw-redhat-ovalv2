    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Quay 3.3 uses an affected version of nodejs-tar. However Quay 3.3 is in extended life phase and a fix will not be delivered[1]. More recent versions of Red Hat Quay do not include nodejs-tar and are not affected.\n\n1. https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/rhquay\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux version 8 and Red Hat Software Collection both embed node-tar in the npm command. However, npm explicitly prevents the extraction of symlink via a filter. npm might still be affected via node-gyp, if the attacker is able to control the target URL.",
