    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: Insufficient Regular Expression Complexity in prismjs leads to a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this flaw to cause an application to consume an excess amount of CPU by providing a crafted HTML comment as input. This can result in a denial of service attack. \n            STATEMENT: OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) grafana-container does package a vulnerable verison of prismjs. However due to the instance being read only and behind OpenShift OAuth, it has been given a Low impact. Additionally it has been marked as wont-fix at this time and may be fixed in a future release.\n\nJust as OCP, OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) components are behind OpenShift OAuth what reducing impact to Low.",
