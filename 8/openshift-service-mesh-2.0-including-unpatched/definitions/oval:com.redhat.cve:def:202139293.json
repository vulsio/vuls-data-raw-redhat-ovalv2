    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in archive/zip of the Go standard library. Applications written in Go can panic or potentially exhaust system memory when parsing malformed ZIP files. An attacker capable of submitting a crafted ZIP file to a Go application using archive/zip to process that file could cause a denial of service via memory exhaustion or panic. This particular flaw is an incomplete fix for a previous flaw. \n            STATEMENT: * In OpenShift Container Platform, multiple components are written in Go and use archive/zip from the standard library. However, all such components are short lived client side tools, not long lived server side executables. As the maximum impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service in client utilities, this vulnerability is rated Low for OpenShift Container Platform.\n\n* This flaw is out of support scope for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. For more information about Red Hat Enterprise Linux support scope, please see https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata\n\n* Because Service Telemetry Framework1.2 will be retiring soon and the flaw's impact is lower, no update will be provided at this time for STF1.2's smart-gateway-container and sg-core-container.",
