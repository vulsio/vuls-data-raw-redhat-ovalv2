		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the big package of the math library in golang. The Rat.SetString could cause an overflow, and if left unhandled, it could lead to excessive memory use. This issue could allow a remote attacker to impact the availability of the system. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 are affected, because the code-base is affected by this vulnerability.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact, and the issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, hence, marked as Out-of-Support-Scope. \n\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/ and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle & Updates Policy: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",
