    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A broken cryptographic algorithm flaw was found in golang.org/x/crypto/ssh. This issue causes a client to fail authentication with RSA keys to servers that reject signature algorithms based on SHA-2, enabling an attacker to crash the server, resulting in a loss of availability. \n            STATEMENT: In OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) the vulnerable golang.org/x/crypto/ssh package is bundled in many components. The affected code is in the SSH server portion that is not used, hence the impact by this vulnerability is reduced. Additionally the OCP installer components, that also bundle vulnerable golang.org/x/crypto/ssh package, are used only during the cluster installation process, hence for already deployed and running OCP clusters the installer components are considered as affected by this vulnerability but not impacted.",
