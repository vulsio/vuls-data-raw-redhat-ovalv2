		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Ramda NPM package that involves prototype poisoning. This flaw allows attackers to supply a crafted object, affecting the integrity or availability of the application. \n            STATEMENT: In Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) the affected components are the application-ui container up to and including RHACM 2.4.4, 2.3.10 and 2.2.13 and grc-ui container up to and including RHACM 2.2.13 versions. However not any RHACM is affected in the kui-web-terminal container as is using already patched and not affected version, therefore we are not impacted in this particular component. In RHACM these components are behind OpenShift OAuth. This restricts access to the vulnerable ramda library to authenticated users only, therefore the impact is reduced to Moderate.",
