		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: There's a flaw in golang's syscall.ForkExec() interface. An attacker who manages to first cause a file descriptor exhaustion for the process, then cause syscall.ForkExec() to be called repeatedly, could compromise data integrity and/or confidentiality in a somewhat uncontrolled way in programs linked with and using syscall.ForkExec(). \n            STATEMENT: * This flaw has had the severity level set to Moderate due to the attack complexity required to exhaust file descriptors at the time ForkExec is called, plus an attacker does not necessarily have direct control over where/how data is leaked.\n\n* For Service Telemetry Framework, because the flaw's impact is lower, no update will be provided at this time for its containers.\n\n* runc shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 are not affected by this flaw because the flaw is already patched in the shipped versions.\n            MITIGATION: This bug can be mitigated by raising the per-process file descriptor limit.",
