		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the elliptic package of the crypto library in golang when the IsOnCurve function could return true for invalid field elements. This flaw allows an attacker to take advantage of this undefined behavior, affecting the availability and integrity of the resource. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9 are affected because the code-base is affected by this vulnerability.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a Moderate security impact. The issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7; hence, marked as Out-of-Support-Scope. \n\nRed Hat Developer Tools - Compilers (go-toolset-1.16 & 1.17), will not be addressed in future updates as shipped only in RHEL-7, hence, marked as Out-of-Support-Scope.\n\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/ and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle & Updates Policy: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",
