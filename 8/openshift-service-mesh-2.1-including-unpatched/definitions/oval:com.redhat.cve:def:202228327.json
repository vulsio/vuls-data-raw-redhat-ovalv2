    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: An integer overflow flaw was found in Golang's crypto/elliptic library. This flaw allows an attacker to use a crafted scaler input longer than 32 bytes, causing P256().ScalarMult or P256().ScalarBaseMult to panic, leading to a loss of availability. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, 8 and 9 are affected, because the code-base is affected by this vulnerability.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact, and the issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, hence, marked as Out-of-Support-Scope. \n\nRed Hat Developer Tools - Compilers (go-toolset-1.16-golang & go-toolset-1.17-golang), ships the vulnerable code and affected by this vulnerability.\n\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/ and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle & Updates Policy: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",
