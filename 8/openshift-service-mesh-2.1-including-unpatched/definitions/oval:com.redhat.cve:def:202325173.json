		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in containerd, where supplementary groups are not set up properly inside a container. If an attacker has direct access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group access, they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass primary group restrictions in some cases. This issue can allow access to sensitive information or gain the ability to execute code in that container. \n            STATEMENT: The following products include containerd related code, but do not use the specific Go packages impacted by this CVE, `containerd/cri/server` and `containerd/oci`. This CVE is therefore rated Low for these products:\n\n* OpenShift Container Platform\n* OpenShift Service Mesh\n* OpenShift API for Data Protection\n* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security\n* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes",
