    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found In etcd, where a large slice causes panic in the decodeRecord method. The size of a record is stored in the length field of a WAL file, and no additional validation is performed on this data. Therefore, it is possible to forge an extremely large frame size that can unintentionally panic at the expense of any RAFT participant trying to decode the WAL. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. \n            STATEMENT: * In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP), the affected components are behind OpenShift OAuth authentication. This restricts access to the vulnerable etcd to authenticated users only.\n* In Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), the use of etcd is limited to the internal API network, which is not accessible to OpenStack tenants.\n\nThe security impact for these products is therefore rated as Low.",
