		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: An improper authorization flaw was discovered in openstack-selinux's applied policy where it does not prevent a non-root user in a container from privilege escalation. A non-root attacker in one or more Red Hat OpenStack (RHOSP) containers could send messages to the dbus. With access to the dbus, the attacker could start or stop services, possibly causing a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: In Red Hat OpenStack Platform 15, because the flaw has a lower impact and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP openstack-selinux package.\n            MITIGATION: There is no known mitigation for this issue, the flaw can only be resolved by applying updates.",
