		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in ansible-runner. An improper escaping of the shell command, while calling the ansible_runner.interface.run_command, can lead to parameters getting executed as host's shell command. A developer could unintentionally write code that gets executed in the host rather than the virtual environment. \n            STATEMENT: Satellite 6.12 and later versions are not affected by this flaw.",
