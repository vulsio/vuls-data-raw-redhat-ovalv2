		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in FRRouting that involves a heap-based buffer overflow in the bgp_attr_aigp_valid() function within bgpd/bgp_attr.c. This flaw allows a remote attacker to send specially crafted data to the application, initiating an out-of-bounds read error and executing a denial of service (DoS) attack. \n            STATEMENT: In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, the vulnerable code is not included. It was added in FRR-8.5 in upstream. The highest version of FRR utilized in RHEL-8 is 7.5. Hence, versions of FRR shipped with RHEL-8 are not affected by this vulnerability.",
