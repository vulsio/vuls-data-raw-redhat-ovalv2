		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in microcode. Fast store forwarding prediction in one domain could be controlled by software previously executed in another domain. Such control helps a malicious program running in user mode (or guest VM) to trigger transient execution gadgets in supervisor mode (or VMM), potentially leading to sensitive data disclosure. Fast store forward prediction is not enabled when SSBD is set. This flaw allows an authenticated user with local access to perform information disclosure via transient execution. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat has very limited to no visibility and control over binary blobs provided by third-party vendors. Red Hat relies heavily on the vendors to provide timely updates and information about included changes for this content and in most cases merely acts as a release vehicle between the third-party vendor and Red Hat customers with no possibility of influencing or even documenting the changes. Unless explicitly stated, the level of insight, oversight, and control Red Hat has does not meet the criteria required (in terms of Red Hat owned development processes and QA, documentation) for releasing this content as RHSA. For more information please contact the binary content vendor.",
