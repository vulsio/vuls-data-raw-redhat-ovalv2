		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the vhost library in DPDK. Function vhost_user_set_inflight_fd() does not validate `msg->payload.inflight.num_queues`, possibly causing out-of-bounds memory read/write. Any software using DPDK vhost library may crash as a result of this vulnerability. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw does not affect Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 and 4 as dpdk (embedded in ceph source rpm) is not built in the packages, therefore the vulnerable code is not available in the resulting RPM and the issue cannot be exploited.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
