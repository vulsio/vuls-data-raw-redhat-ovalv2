		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A heap use-after-free vulnerability was found in Vim's utf_ptr2char() function of the src/mbyte.c file. This flaw occurs because vim is using a buffer line after it has been freed in the old regexp engine. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap use-after-free that causes an application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory. \n            STATEMENT: All versions of Vim shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux are affected, because of the presence of vulnerable code in our code-base.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Virtualization 4 consumes RHEL-8 vim, and as RHEL-8 is affected, Hence, RHEV is also affected.\n\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a Low security impact, because the \"victim\" has to run an untrusted file IN SCRIPT MODE. Someone who is running untrusted files in script mode is equivalent to someone just taking a random python script and running it.\n\nSince Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 are Out-of-Support-Scope for Low/Moderate flaws, the issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates for RHEL-6,7. Only Important and Critical severity flaws will be addressed at this time.\n\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/ and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle & Updates Policy: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.\n            MITIGATION: Untrusted vim scripts with -s [scriptin] are not recommended to run.",
