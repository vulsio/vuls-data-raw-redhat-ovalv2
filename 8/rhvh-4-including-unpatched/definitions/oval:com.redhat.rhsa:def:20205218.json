These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines.

These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: imgbased (1.2.13), redhat-release-virtualization-host (4.4.3), redhat-virtualization-host (4.4.3). (BZ#1814517, BZ#1868293, BZ#1886484)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* libssh: denial of service when handling AES-CTR (or DES) ciphers (CVE-2020-1730)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* [security] gnutls_set_default_priority() (and thus Cockpit logins) fails when selecting VPP profile during RHVH installation (BZ#1835661)\n\n* Unable to upgrade from rhvh 4.4.1 to 4.4.2 as block storage domains are detected as local storage domains. (BZ#1886647)\n\n* Failed to install RHVH 4.4.3 due to missing Lvm ThinPool (BZ#1886695)",
