		"description": "The redhat-virtualization-host packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks. \n\nThe ovirt-node-ng packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: cockpit-ovirt (0.14.15), redhat-release-virtualization-host (4.4.3), redhat-virtualization-host (4.4.3), v2v-conversion-host (1.16.2). (BZ#1898023, BZ#1902301, BZ#1907539)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* lldpd: buffer overflow in the lldp_decode function in daemon/protocols/lldp.c (CVE-2015-8011)\n\n* nodejs-lodash: prototype pollution in zipObjectDeep function (CVE-2020-8203)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* Previously, upgrade from Red Had Virtualization (RHV) 4.4.1 to RHV 4.4.2 failed due to dangling symlinks from the iSCSI Storage Domain that weren't cleaned up. In this release, the upgrade succeeds. (BZ#1895356)\n\n* Previously, when migrating a Windows virtual machine from a VMware environment to Red Hat Virtualization 4.4.3, the migration failed due to a file permission error. In this release, the migration succeeds. (BZ#1901423)",
