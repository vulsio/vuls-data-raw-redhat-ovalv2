		"description": "The redhat-virtualization-host packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks. \n\nThe ovirt-node-ng packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: redhat-release-virtualization-host (4.4.4), redhat-virtualization-host (4.4.4)\n\nChanges to the imgbased component:\n\n* Previously, the chronyd symlink was removed during the upgrade process. As a result, the chronyd service was disabled following the upgrade.\nIn this release, the chronyd service is enabled after upgrade. (BZ#1903777)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* lldp/openvswitch: denial of service via externally triggered memory leak (CVE-2020-27827)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.",
