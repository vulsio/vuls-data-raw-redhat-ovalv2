    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in nodejs-path-parse. All versions of package path-parse are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via splitDeviceRe, splitTailRe, and splitPathRe regular expressions. ReDoS exhibits polynomial worst-case time complexity. \n            STATEMENT: In Red Had Quay , whilst a vulnerable version of `path-parse` is included in the quay-rhel8 container it is a development dependency only, hence the impact by this vulnerability is low.\n\nIn OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), the hadoop component which is a part of the OCP metering stack, ships the vulnerable version of 'path-parse'.\nSince the release of OCP 4.6, the metering product has been deprecated [1], hence the affected component is marked as wontfix.\nThis may be fixed in the future.\n\nIn Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage 4 the noobaa-core container includes the affected version of `path-parse`, however the vulnerable functionality is currently not used in any part of the product.\n\nIn Red Hat Virtualization cockpit-ovirt, ovirt-engine-ui-extensions and ovirt-web-ui use vulnerable version of `path-parse`, however for cockpit-ovirt it is a development time dependency only, and for ovirt-engine-ui-extensions and ovirt-web-ui the vulnerable functions are never used.\n\n[1] https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/release_notes/ocp-4-6-release-notes.html#ocp-4-6-metering-operator-deprecated",
