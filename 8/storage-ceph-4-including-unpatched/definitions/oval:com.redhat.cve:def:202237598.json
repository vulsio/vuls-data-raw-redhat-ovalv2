		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A prototype pollution vulnerability was found in UglifyJS, stemming from the DEFNODE function in ast.js via the name variable. Exploiting this flaw involves adding or altering properties of the Object.prototype through a \"__proto__\" or constructor payload, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary code or causing a denial of service on the system. \n            STATEMENT: OpenShift Service Mesh is closed as wontfix, as @types/uglify-js is hoisted from the storybook, which is a dev dep only and does not affect the production Kiali container. Also, this dependency has been removed completely from OSSM 2.3.\n\nUpstream doesn't consider this as a vulnerability. Refer to the \"External References\" section for more details.",
