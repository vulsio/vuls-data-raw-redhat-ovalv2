		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: An uncontrolled resource consumption flaw was found in Golang math/big. A too-short encoded message can cause a panic in Float.GobDecode and Rat.GobDecode in math/big in Go, potentially allowing an attacker to create a denial of service, impacting availability. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw stems from a particular and specific method (GoBDecode) which isn't commonly used. There are few components within Red Hat offerings which call this function. In rare cases where this method is called, the component limits possible damage or it is not possible to be triggered by an attacker. For these combined reasons the impact has been downgraded to Low.",
