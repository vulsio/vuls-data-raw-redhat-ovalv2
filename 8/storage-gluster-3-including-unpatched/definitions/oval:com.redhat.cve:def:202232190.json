		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the golang package. The JoinPath doesn't remove the ../ path components appended to a domain that is not terminated by a slash, possibly leading to a directory traversal attack. \n            STATEMENT: The vulnerable functions, JoinPath and URL.JoinPath was introduced in upstream go1.19, whereas, RHEL ships go1.17 and go1.18 versions, which does not contain the vulnerable code. Hence, packages shipped with RHEL-8, RHEL-9 are not affected.\n\nAll Y stream releases of OpenShift Container Platform 4 run on RHEL-8 or RHEL-9, so OCP 4 is also not affected.",
