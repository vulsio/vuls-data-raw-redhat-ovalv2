		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the logback package. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') via the logback receiver component. This flaw allows an  attacker to mount a denial-of-service attack by sending poisoned data. \n            STATEMENT: The security vulnerability in the logback package is considered of moderate severity due to its potential for facilitating a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. While a DoS attack can disrupt service availability, this vulnerability may not lead to more severe consequences such as unauthorized access or data breaches.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
