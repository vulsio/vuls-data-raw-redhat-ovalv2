		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Bouncy Castle Java Cryptography APIs. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to a use of incorrectly-resolved name or reference issue when resolving domain names over an SSL socket that was created without an explicit hostname, such as in the HttpsURLConnection() function. If endpoint identification is enabled, this flow allows an attacker to trigger hostname verification against a DNS-resolved address. \n            STATEMENT: The vulnerability in Bouncy Castle Java Cryptography APIs, allowing for incorrect resolution of domain names during SSL/TLS connections without explicitly specifying a hostname, is assessed as moderate severity due to its potential impact on security. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker could manipulate DNS resolution to present a different server's certificate, leading to a mismatch between expected and verified hostnames. While this could facilitate a man-in-the-middle attack under specific conditions, its severity is moderated by the prerequisite of the attacker controlling DNS responses or intercepting network traffic.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
