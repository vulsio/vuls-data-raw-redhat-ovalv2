		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the mod_proxy module of httpd. A NULL pointer dereference can be triggered when processing a specially crafted HTTP request, causing the httpd server to crash, and resulting in a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: As this flaw allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service, it has been rated with an important severity.\n\nThis flaw only affects configurations with mod_proxy loaded and being used. This module can be disabled via the configuration file if its functionality is not being used.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
