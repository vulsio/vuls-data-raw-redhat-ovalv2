		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A use-after-free vulnerability was found in OpenSSL. Calling the OpenSSL API SSL_free_buffers function may cause memory to be accessed that was previously freed in some situations. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat classifies this vulnerability as having a low impact because the affected function is infrequently used by applications. However, Red Hat includes this function in their regular packages, which is why the related components are listed as affected in the table below.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
