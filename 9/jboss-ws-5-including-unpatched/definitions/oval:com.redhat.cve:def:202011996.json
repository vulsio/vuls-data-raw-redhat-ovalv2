		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: A specially crafted sequence of HTTP/2 requests sent to Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M5, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.35 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.55 could trigger high CPU usage for several seconds. If a sufficient number of such requests were made on concurrent HTTP/2 connections, the server could become unresponsive. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat OpenStack Platform's OpenDaylight will not be updated for this flaw because it was deprecated as of RHOSP14 and is only receiving security fixes for Important and Critical flaws.\nApache Tomcat versions as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 are not affected by this flaw as it doesn't support HTTP/2 protocol.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 8's Identity Management is using an affected version of Tomcat bundled within PKI servlet engine, however HTTP/2 protocol is not supported by this component.",
