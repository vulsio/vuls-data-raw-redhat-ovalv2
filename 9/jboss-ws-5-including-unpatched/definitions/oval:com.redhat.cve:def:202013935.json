		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Apache Tomcat, where the payload length in a WebSocket frame was not correctly validated. Invalid payload lengths could trigger an infinite loop. Multiple requests with invalid payload lengths could lead to a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Certificate System 10.0 as well as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8's Identity Management, are using a vulnerable version of Tomcat, bundled into the pki-servlet-engine component. However, there is no entry point for WebSockets, thus it is not possible to trigger the flaw in a supported setup. A future update may fix the code. Similarly, Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 does not ship with WebSocket functionality enabled by default.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update as soon as possible.",
