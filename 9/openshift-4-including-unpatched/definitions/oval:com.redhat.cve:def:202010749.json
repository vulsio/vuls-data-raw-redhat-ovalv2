		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in affected container networking implementations that allow malicious containers in Kubernetes clusters to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. A malicious container can exploit this flaw by sending “rogue” IPv6 router advertisements to the host or other containers, to redirect traffic to the malicious container. \n            STATEMENT: In OpenShift Container Platform 4, the default network plugin, OpenShift SDN, and OVN Kubernetes, do not forward IPv6 traffic, making this vulnerability not exploitable. The affected code from containernetworking/plugins is however still included in these plugins, hence this vulnerability is rated Low for both OpenShift SDN and OVN-Kubernetes.\n\nIPv6 traffic is not forwarded by the OpenShift SDN in OpenShift Container Platform 3.11, making this vulnerability not exploitable. However, the affected code from containernetworking/plugins is still included in the atomic-openshift package, hence this vulnerability is rated Low for OpenShift Container Platform 3.11.\n            MITIGATION: Prevent untrusted, non-privileged containers from running with CAP_NET_RAW.",
