		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was discovered in Podman where it incorrectly allows containers when created to overwrite existing files in volumes, even if they are mounted as read-only. When a user runs a malicious container or a container based on a malicious image with an attached volume that is used for the first time, it is possible to trigger the flaw and overwrite files in the volume. \n            STATEMENT: Podman versions earlier than 1.6.0 are not affected. That includes the podman versions in OCP 4.2 and earlier.\n            MITIGATION: If a volume needs to be attached as read-only to an untrusted container or container image, first attach it to a trusted container. Using the volume for the first time will make the attack impossible for other containers that are going to use the volume.",
