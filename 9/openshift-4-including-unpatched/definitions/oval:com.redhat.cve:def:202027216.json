		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: In Eclipse Jetty versions 1.0 thru 9.4.32.v20200930, 10.0.0.alpha1 thru 10.0.0.beta2, and 11.0.0.alpha1 thru 11.0.0.beta2O, on Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. A collocated user can observe the process of creating a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary directory and race to complete the creation of the temporary subdirectory. If the attacker wins the race then they will have read and write permission to the subdirectory used to unpack web applications, including their WEB-INF/lib jar files and JSP files. If any code is ever executed out of this temporary directory, this can lead to a local privilege escalation vulnerability. \n            STATEMENT: In OpenShift Container Platform (OCP), the Hive/Presto/Hadoop components that comprise the OCP Metering stack, ship the vulnerable version of jetty.\nSince the release of OCP 4.6, the Metering product has been deprecated [1], hence the affected components are marked as wontfix.\nThis may be fixed in the future.\n\n[1] https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/release_notes/ocp-4-6-release-notes.html#ocp-4-6-metering-operator-deprecated\n            MITIGATION: Jetty users should create temp folders outside the normal /tmp structure, and ensure that their permissions are set so as not to be accessible by an attacker.",
