		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: This affects the package npm-user-validate before 1.0.1. The regex that validates user emails took exponentially longer to process long input strings beginning with @ characters. \n            STATEMENT: In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and Software Collections, `npm-user-validate` is used exclusively for `npm`. As a result, this vulnerability is considered Low in such a context.\n\nIn OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 3.11 and 4.4 the kibana package has been marked Low (similar to RHEL8) as it is primarily used for npm and is protected via OpenShift OAuth. Additionally, whilst OCP 4.4 does deliver the kibana package, due to the code changing to container first content, it has been marked as wontfix at this time and may be fixed in a future release. \n\nAdditionally, the openshift4/ose-logging-kibana6 container is not represented on the CVE page as it gets npm from the Red Hat Software Collections and as such the ose-logging-kibana6 container will be updated when the rh-nodejs10-nodejs package is.",
