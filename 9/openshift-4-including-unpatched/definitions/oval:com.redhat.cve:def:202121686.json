		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A link following vulnerability was found in Jenkins. The file path filters do not canonicalize paths allowing operations to follow symbolic links to directories they are not supposed to have access to. This may allow an attacker to read and write arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system. \n            \n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
