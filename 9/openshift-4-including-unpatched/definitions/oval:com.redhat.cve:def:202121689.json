An attacker with access to FilePath#unzip or FilePath#untar operations is able to read and write arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system. \n            \n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example.
