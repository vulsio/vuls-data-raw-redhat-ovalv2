		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A file path filtering bypass vulnerability was found in Jenkins. Agent processes are able to completely bypass file path filtering by wrapping the file operation in an agent file path. This may allow an attacker who controls the agent process to get read and write access to arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system. \n            \n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
