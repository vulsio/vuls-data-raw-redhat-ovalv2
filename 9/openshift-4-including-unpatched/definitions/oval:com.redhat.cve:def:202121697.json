		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: An incorrect access restriction vulnerability was found in Jenkins. The directories agents are allowed to access include the directories where there are stored build-related information intended to allow agents to store build-related metadata during build execution. As a consequence, this allows an attacker who controls agent process to read and write the contents of any build directory stored in Jenkins with very few restrictions (build.xml and some Pipeline-related metadata). \n            \n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
