This is a variation of the vulnerability reported in CVE-2021-28164/GHSA-v7ff-8wcx-gmc5. \n            STATEMENT: OCP 3.11 is out of the support scope for Moderate and Low impact vulnerabilities because is already in the Maintenance Support phase, hence the affected OCP 3.11 component has been marked as \"ooss\".\n\nRed Hat OpenStack Platform's OpenDaylight will not be updated for this flaw because it was deprecated as of OpenStack Platform 14 and is only receiving security fixes for Critical flaws.",
