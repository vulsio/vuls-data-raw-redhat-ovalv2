		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the way HAProxy processed HTTP responses containing the \"Set-Cookie2\" header. This flaw could allow an attacker to send crafted HTTP response packets which lead to an infinite loop, eventually resulting in a denial of service condition. The highest threat from this vulnerability is availability. \n            STATEMENT: This issue was introduced in HAProxy 1.9 with the Native HTTP Representation (HTX). Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, 8 and Red Hat Software Collections are not affected by this flaw, as they ship older versions of `haproxy` which do not include support for HTX.",
