		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in Ignition, where ignition configs are accessible from unprivileged containers in VMs running on VMware products. This issue is only relevant in user environments where the Ignition config contains secrets. \n            STATEMENT: RHCOS may be less impacted than other distros since OCP's default Ignition config only contains a pointer to a config served by the Machine Config Server, and  OCP prevents containers from accessing the MCS directly.  So, the scope on RHCOS should be limited to any VMware users who manually modify the pointer config to include secrets.\n            MITIGATION: Possible Workaround: It is not recommended to put secrets in the Ignition config.",
