		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in crun where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty default permissions. A vulnerability was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where containers were started incorrectly with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities. This flaw allows an attacker with access to programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set when execve(2) runs. \n            STATEMENT: This issue is related to the general vulnerability found in Moby (Docker Engine), which has been assigned CVE-2022-24769.\n\nAmong the supported OpenShift Container Platform releases, only v4.10 is affected by this flaw.\n            MITIGATION: The entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like capsh(1) to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.",
