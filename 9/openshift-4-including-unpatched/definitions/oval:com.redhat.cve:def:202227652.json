		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in cri-o, where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty default permissions. A vulnerability was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where containers started incorrectly with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities. This flaw allows an attacker with access to programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set when execve(2) runs. \n            STATEMENT: This issue is related to the general vulnerability found in Moby (Docker Engine), which has been assigned CVE-2022-24769. After further investigation we came to the conclusion that this CVE has a very minimal impact on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.\n            MITIGATION: The entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like capsh(1) to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.",
