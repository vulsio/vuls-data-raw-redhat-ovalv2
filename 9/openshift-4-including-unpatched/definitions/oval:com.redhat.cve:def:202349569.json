		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in the go library go-git. This issue may allow an attacker to create and amend files across the filesystem when applications are using the default ChrootOS, potentially allowing remote code execution. \n            STATEMENT: This problem only affects the go implementation and not the original git cli code. Applications using BoundOS or in-memory filesystems are not affected by this issue. Clients should be limited to connect to only trusted git servers to reduce the risk of compromise.\n\nIn OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) the vulnerable github.com/go-git/go-git/v5 Go package is used as a dependency in many components where the vulnerable function is not used, hence the impact by this vulnerability is reduced to Low.\n            MITIGATION: In cases where a bump to the latest version of go-git is not possible, a recommendation to reduce the exposure of this threat is limiting its use to only trust-worthy Git servers.",
