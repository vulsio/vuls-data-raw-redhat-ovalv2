		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in keycloak. In certain conditions, this issue may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to block other accounts from logging in. \n            STATEMENT: While this attack enables locking out an individual from their account, the entire system will remain in operation. The follow conditions are required for successful exploitation:\n- The realm is configured to use \"User (Self) registration\"\n- The user registers with a username in email format\n- The attacker discovers a valid email address for an account\n\nDue to these conditions, the security impact has been rated Low.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat Product Security is not aware of a way to completely mitigate this issue. However, the following techniques can be used to help prevent exploitation:\n- Put limits on frequency of account registration, restricting how often an attacker could utilize this attack \n- Restrict new account registration to not allow email addresses in the username field, for example, by not allowing the \"@\" symbol. Note: this cannot prevent attacks against existing users who have registered with an email address.",
