		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the python-certifi package. This issue occurs when the e-Tugra root certificate in Certifi is removed, resulting in an unspecified error that has an unknown impact and attack vector. \n            STATEMENT: The discussed vulnerability regarding the eTurgra certificates being marked as untrusted by Mozilla, while significant from a trust and security standpoint, can be considered a low severity issue for several reasons. Firstly, the certificates were removed from Mozilla's root store in July 2023, indicating a proactive response to the reported security concerns. Additionally, Red Hat do not run our own root store program. We depend on Mozilla (for ssl certificates) and Microsoft (for signing certificates). These certs are included and marked as don't trust after following Mozilla. They will not be removed until Mozilla removes them. Applications most at risk are browsers, which already understand and parse the 'don't trust after'. If it's a requirement that python-fi not trust these certs, they should parse the 'don't trust after' attribute.",
