    "description": "DOCUMENTATION: A resource-consumption vulnerability was found in rubygem addressable, where its URI template implementation could allow an attacker's crafted template to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat CloudForms 5.0 (CFME 5.11) is in the maintenance support phase and we are no longer fixing Moderate/Low severity security bugs. Reference: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/cloudforms\n\nOpenShift 3.11 components are currently in maintenance support phase, hence Moderate/Low severity security bugs are set as Out Of Support Scope (OOSS). Reference: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift_noncurrent\n            MITIGATION: Create template objects only from trusted sources that have been validated not to produce catastrophic backtracking.",
