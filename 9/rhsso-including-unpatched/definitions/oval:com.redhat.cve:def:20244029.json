		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in Wildflyâ€™s management interface. Due to the lack of limitation of sockets for the management interface, it may be possible to cause a denial of service hitting the nofile limit as there is no possibility to configure or set a maximum number of connections. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat rates this as a Low impact since this requires high privileges to jeopardize the system. The management interface is normally internal/local only and not exposed externally.\n            MITIGATION: Currently there is no available mitigation for this vulnerability. Please make sure to perform updates as they become available.",
