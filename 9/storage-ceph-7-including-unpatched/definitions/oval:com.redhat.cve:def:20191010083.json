		"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in python-flask. Unexpected memory usage can occur through specially crafted encoded JSON data. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. Note, this may overlap CVE-2018-1000656. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Satellite 6.5 ships an affected version of python-flask. However, the product is not vulnerable since the data component Crane receives from pulp_docker repository metadata with JSON uses UTF-8 encoding by default. Other supported versions of the Satellite are not affected by this vulnerability.\n\nNote: CVE-2019-1010083 is a duplicate of the flaw in CVE-2018-1000656. However, the 2019 flaw identifies newer affected products.",
